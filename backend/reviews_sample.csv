2818,1191.0,3/30/2009,10952,Lam,Daniel is really cool. The place was nice and clean. Very quiet neighborhood. He had maps and a lonely planet guide book in the room for you to use. I didnt have any trouble finding the place from Central Station. I would defintely come back! Thanks!
515749,1671407.0,7/9/2012,2640670,Gregory,"If you want the authentic Amsterdam houseboat experience, this is it!  It is a great boat, located on a quiet canal with a view of the Rijksmuseum towers.  Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, hot shower, good wifi signal, nice kitchen with fridge, cofee maker, and stove for cooking meals.  The location is very accessible to museums, gym bar and bakery on the corner, nine streets area with lots of resaraunts and bars and jazz clubs, Vondelpark, shopping on Utrechtstraat, and all of the sites of central Amsterdam.  <br/><br/>Now for the special part: If you are at all interested in boats and maritime history, this one is a great find.  The cabin where guests stay is actually the cargo hold within the original hull of a freight boat that once hauled goods all over Holland.  (Just imagine the countless tons of cargo that came in and out of the place where you are sleeping!)  And yet the interior beautifully and comfortably remodeled using new and salvaged materials including a number of hatches that serve as skylights.  The original steerhouse is still intact, along with the original one-cylinder engine down below.  But the highlight is the captain's quarters where the family who owned and operated the boat lived during the 1920s (not open for guests to sleep in, yet).  Stepping down into the quarters, complete with original cabinets and cookstove, feels like traveling back in time.  The host cares a lot about preserving the historical character of his boat, because most other boats like it have long since gone to the scrapyard.  He showed us fascinating photographs of the original owners who lived on the boat when it plied the canals nearly 100 years ago.  <br/><br/>There are many houseboats in Amsterdam.  A lot of them are glorified trailer houses on flat barges.  This one is a gem."
515749,1715674.0,7/15/2012,1032804,Michael,"Unique and luxurious to be sure. I couldn't recommend staying with Derk any more highly.<br/><br/>Coolest thing first: We showed up to Derk's and he actually had three houseboats in a row, and offered to show up the one we saw on the site and another, and let us choose our favorite to stay in!  We had an incredible boat with wired internet, a comfortable bed and a very comfortable futon, TV, speakers, hot water, a shower, washer/dryer.  I couldn't believe I was on a boat.  Plus the charm of being on one was fantastic, and the views out onto the canal were fantastic.  It rained one morning and was such a beautiful way to wake up.<br/><br/>In addition, Derk was really communicative, responded to our last minute (day before!) request for a reservation quite casually, and met us right at the boat.  He even had a few cold beers in the fridge for us, and was really great explaining the area.<br/><br/>Would recommend!"
2818,1771.0,4/24/2009,12798,Alice,"Daniel is the most amazing host! His place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). He is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. Highly recommended!"
515749,1963378.0,8/12/2012,503786,Brian,"My wife and I recently stopped in Amsterdam for a few days during our honeymoon. We didn't want to stay in the typical Amsterdam hotel and opted for something special - a traditional Dutch houseboat.  Needless to say staying on a boat was a special experience, but the boat was very clean, was on a quiet canal in a superb location in central Amsterdam, and had everything we needed for a memorable weekend.  The owner was good to make some worthwhile recommendations for us and was very flexible with the boat itself (he offered us his other boat in case we preferred that one), etc.  I will definitely try to book this houseboat again when I return to Amsterdam next."
515749,2073958.0,8/23/2012,2869021,Nadége,"Nous avons pass 5 jours parfait chez Derk! Le quartier est super sympa, très calme et très central. Tout est à proximité directe,louer des vélos permet de se the placer facilement et de découvrir la ville autrement ! Notre séjour sur la péniche a été très sympa. C'est trés mignon, bien equipé, avec une vue magnifique sur le rijksmuseum, sur un petit bout de canal calme et ensoleillé.Derk a été adorable! Nous avons adoré cette expérience et nous recommandons vivement!"
515749,2221365.0,9/7/2012,2804901,Anita,"Location is Perfect with-in walking distance of Vondelpark, Van Gogh Museum, Heineken museum, Dam square, Waterlooplein market and of course Jordaan’s charming lanes.  (hire a bike from around the corner, travel one side of the city to the other in minutes!) <br/>Every corner you turn has something to offer. <br/>The boat is moored on a quite, peaceful, picturesque canal. Cafe, restaurants, bars, supermarket and shops all minutes away.<br/>Derk is such a nice guy, he was extremely helpful and is so laid back. His home is yours and you feel very welcome.<br/>The boat is charming, clean and comfortable (we got a choice of boats, which ever suited us best!)  Instant running hot water, wifi, cooker the lot all you need for a comfy stay.<br/>We took our 2.5yr old with us and she felt she was in a fairytale, sleeping on a boat, she got up each morning to feed the swans and ducks from the boat, and then later swam naked with all the other toddlers in Vondelpark fountains.<br/>We left planing our next stay, so I really can not recommend this holiday anymore, it was perfect. If you want a unique, unforgettable experience then go for this boat. "
2818,1989.0,5/3/2009,11869,Natalja,"We had such a great time in Amsterdam. Daniel is an excellent host! Very friendly and everytime helpful. The room was cozy, comfortable, and VERY clean. Maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. Bathroom with all the bathroom requires. Good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center.<br/>Totally recommendable! "
2818,2797.0,5/18/2009,14064,Enrique,Very professional operation. Room is very clean and comfortable. Location is close to tram or bus which take you to most of attractions. A great and helpful host who want to ensure you enjoy your stay.  
2818,3151.0,5/25/2009,17977,Sherwin,Daniel is highly recommended.  He provided all necessities (and actually went way beyond what's expected of a great host). His place is very clean.  It is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  You will truly feel like a local here.
2818,4748.0,6/29/2009,20192,Jie,"Daniel was a great host! He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!<br/><br/>"
2818,5202.0,7/7/2009,23055,Vanessa,"Daniele is an amazing host! He provided everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable and easy! The rooms were clean and cozy; and he took the time to show us how to get around Amsterdam via public transportation or riding around on bicycles. You truly do feel like a local when staying with Daniele!!<br/>"
515749,2277642.0,9/14/2012,3073584,Marcelo,"I lived in Amsterdam for three years and away wondered what it would be like to stay in a house boat - the experience was excellent and Derek is a great guy, very easygoing and flexible. Highly recommended."
515749,2391406.0,9/24/2012,3155853,Klaus,"Das Boot ist super!<br/>Es liegt in einer sehr ruhigen Gracht, genau das richtig um sich auszuruhen und trotzdem so zentral, dass du alles leicht zu Fuß erreichen kannst ( 15 min gehen und du bist im Nachtleben von Amsterdam, 30 min gehen und du bist am Bahnhof, 5 min Frühstück, 10 min Supermarkt) Es ist zweckmäßig eingerichtet. Es ist alles vorhanden, was du braucht, auch wenn du dich selbst verpflegst. <br/>Derk ist ein sehr netter, freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Vermieter"
515749,2469203.0,10/1/2012,2532611,Katja,"We stayed on Derk's boat for a long weekend in Amsterdam. It was great! Sadly we didn't meet Derk, as he was on holiday, so we didn't get to learn the history of the boat as some other guests have. But he left us in good hands with a friend, who met us at the boat to give us the keys and show us around. Rain on the boat's roof is the most soothing thing at nighttime... slept like a baby!!! "
515749,2505468.0,10/4/2012,3482158,Katie,"Derk's boat was amazing.  It was clean and spacious for two people and had all necessary amenities (and more!) to comfortably stay for a few days.  The location was great, 15 minute walk to downtown and red light district, bike rentals right around the corner, 5 minutes to grocery store, yet still in a quiet neighborhood. <br/><br/>Derk was a great host as well.  He was there waiting for us when we arrived and made sure we could hook up to wifi and had all of his contact info in case we had to reach him.  He was a really friendly guy- even left us a couple beers in the fridge.  <br/><br/>We highly recommend staying here!<br/>"
515749,2721446.0,10/26/2012,2909223,Nick,"This is a great place to stay in the heart of Amsterdam. It's a hop, skip and a jump from everything and anything you might want to do.  You get a true houseboat experience - a must from anyone visiting the city.<br/><br/>Derk was a gracious host, very friendly and open for any questions we might have had.<br/><br/>It was a joy to be there."
515749,2760672.0,10/30/2012,3538997,Kevin And Nicky,"The Houseboat was truly fabulous. A great location, less than 10 minutes walk from Rembrandt Square. The boat is warm, spacious, has a good shower and was so much better than a hotel room.<br/>Derk was an excellent host, waiting up for us despite our very late arrival. He was always contactable but left us to ourselves.<br/>We would highly recommend staying with Derk and we are sure we will do so again in the future."
515749,2824656.0,11/7/2012,3573614,Giulia,"The Houseboat was very nice, and the location perfect, very close to the center of Amsterdam. The boat is warm, romantic, and full equiped. Derk was an excellent host, always contactable but left us to ourselves. It was a very beautiful experience!"
515749,2965064.0,11/26/2012,3253052,Elias,"First rate all around. The houseboat is cosy, comfortable and has everything you need for a stay. The restaurants and bars in the nearby UtrechtStraat are superb. Location wise this is perfect for Amsterdam - you can walk anywhere you want and yet it is a quiet residential area. Highly recommend it."
515749,3027370.0,12/4/2012,3737577,Mathilde,The location is perfect and the boat is perfect. Derk is really helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam.

515749,3661225.0,3/1/2013,554380,Emily,"We had such a lovely warm and comfortable stay on Derk’s houseboat. The boat is in a great location; it is very close to some main streets and sights in Amsterdam but is on a quiet residential street. We visited all the attractions whilst in Amsterdam and we were able to walk to each one. There are restaurants, cafes, bakeries all close by. The boat is centrally heated so even though it was freezing outside it was lovely and warm inside. The boat as a whole is much more spacious that it appears in the photos and he bed is very comfortable too!! Ill be recommending Derk’s houseboat to anyone I know going to Amsterdam. We will definitely be back to stay!! :)"
515749,3805178.0,3/17/2013,1517970,Mark,"We had a fantastic stay on the houseboat, even though it was freezing March weather and the ducks were skating on the frozen canal, the boat was very warm and comfortable. The location is perfect, central, but quiet and Derk even arranged tickets to the opera for us - a real bonus and our best night of the trip - thanks Derk, we will definitely be back to experience the boat and Amsterdam in the warmer weather :)"

The boat is in a very central location, restaurants, shops, cafes and the tram are all very close by. Derk was a wonderful host. We'd love to stay here again on our next trip!"
515749,4427164.0,5/5/2013,4655557,Rosane,"For a first experience with airbnb, we're fully satisfied. We had a great time in Amsterdam on Derk's houseboat. Everything was as expected. just one little ""minus"": <br/>The heat was off (of course, we're in May!!) but with this year's cold spring, it was a bit chilly during the night. Thanks to the extra blanket ! <br/>We haven't got the chance to meet Derk, but his neighbor was waiting for us with the keys, so everything went well. <br/>We certainly would recommand that place, and if we come back to Amsterdam, we'll certainly rent it again. Rosane and Romain/Nyon,Switzerland"
785432,3106041.0,12/17/2012,1577936,Gemma,"Fantastic! location, comfort, privacy, freedom... all under one boat roof. Daan is an excellent host - all you could ask for. really. What you see is what you get and doesn't it look awesome?"

2818,9131.0,9/6/2009,26343,Katja,"You can´t have a nicer start in Amsterdam. Daniel is such a great and welcoming host. The room was really light and charming, so well decorated. Daniel has a great sense of hospitality, he even helped with our luggage and gave us maps and a travelguide. He´s very open minded and helpful. We had a great time, we would stay with him again anytime we´re back in Amsterdam. Daniel made sure we had everything for a great trip, thanks again for the bikes! Hope to see you soon, Daniel!"
2818,12103.0,10/1/2009,40999,Marie-Eve,"Daniel was a fantastic host. His place is calm and clean, and he provided so much information on how to enjoy the amazing city of Amsterdam. Should I return to the city, his place will be my first choice! "

515749,4741067.0,5/23/2013,4504364,Leonie,"We loved our stay in Derk's barge. It was so very comfortable and warm, with plenty of room. Lovely hot shower. It was very handy to transport and we had no difficulty finding the local bakery for our croissants. Derk very kindly waited up til our midnight arrival so he could meet us and show us around, and also showed us the rest of the barge which still has its original features.  Would readily recommend Derk's barge and hope we can return some day. We are a retired couple from New Zealand and it was great to have something so different to what we can find in our country."
515749,4769717.0,5/25/2013,1025881,Matthias,"Great place to stay and discover the city. Especially our little ones enjoyed the special atmosphere on the boat.

515749,5576034.0,7/7/2013,5527856,Emma,Derk Lottman is an absolute gentleman. he was there when we arrived and introduce us to the boat which is charming and full of character. An absolute delight to stay there. The canal is quiet and charming as is the location. Loved Amsterdam. You must try the Bar moustache. We will be back  
515749,5727992.0,7/14/2013,660722,Marina,"The boat is something special! It seems so authentic to live in the houseboat while staying in Amsterdam! There is a lot of space and it's so cosy. And there is everything one can need including hot water, wi-fi and TV) It's 5 min wals to Rembrandt place and 15 min walk to Red Quarter. And you can get to Amsterdam Centraal in 15 min by tram. Many thanks to Derk - everything was just fantastic!"
515749,5882693.0,7/21/2013,1179565,Frances,"We spent 3 nights on this unique houseboat.  It has a great location (we did all museums, canal exploring, central Amsterdam ... on foot) and it is very tranquil.  The boat is very comfortable and well-equipped for self-catering. There are food shops, cafés,<br/>restaurants nearby.  We highly recommend it as part of the Amsterdam experience!  "
515749,5962835.0,7/24/2013,1816228,Stuart,"We spent three night's on Derk's houseboat and absolutely loved it. It was clean, fully equipped and the location was perfect, within walking distance of Rembrandtplein square in one direction and the Van Gogh Museum and  Rijksmuseum in another. The wifi worked perfectly and was surprisingly fast. Derk is a very interesting guy (a violinist with De Nederlandse Opera company) and dropped by twice to make sure we had everything we needed - which we did. It was a quintessential Amsterdam experience that we highly recommend.<br/>"
2818,16196.0,11/4/2009,38623,Graham,"Daniel was great. He couldn.t do enough for us. He has gone to a lot of trouble and added every little touch to his apartment. He can speak 5 languages so that should not be a problem for anyone.<br/>The accomation had everything we needed and was very convienient to the bus and tram."
2818,18095.0,11/23/2009,48138,Klaus,"Daniel has been more then a great host: it was like having an home in Amsterdam!<br/>If friendliness and kindness were not enough, the house was super clean and he provided all the things needed for our staying: maps, timetables, suggestions and tips, even bicycles! The location is easy to get to and from the station and the city center, 24h/24h connection, with a relaxing and serviced neighborhood. And don't worry, he speaks 5 languages if you mind having communication problems. Hope to find other guest like him in the future!"
2818,18286.0,11/25/2009,55661,Michael,"Daniel's apartment and room was spotless. Daniel was very friendly throughout our correspondence and was even waiting for me outside his place when I arrived (late). The apartment is very convenient to the center of the city, and an easy walk to the transportation stops. Daniel is well prepared for any guest, providing me with maps and bus schedules. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Daniel is wonderful host."
2818,24925.0,1/27/2010,33284,Araz,"Daniel was an exeptional host!! We only had a short stay in Amsterdam but Daniel was extremely helpful as he had all the local transport timetables mapped out and ready for us to use. His place was very clean and comfortable. Daniel was incredibly accommodating on our last day in Amsterdam. Our flight wasn't till the evening and he was kind enough to let us leave our luggage for the day and return to pick them up before our flight. TOTALLY, TOTALLY, TOTALLY recommend Daniel's place next time you visit Amsterdam."
2818,31154.0,3/24/2010,82918,Natalie,"No amount of praise for Daniel would be corny or excessive.  His place was comfortable and wonderful, and he is an incredibly friendly and accommodating host.  I felt cleaner, safer, and happier than at any hotel.  A friend and I stayed here, and we loved having the twin beds in the same room.  The shower was luxurious and clean, and Daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  I just asked my travel companion ""What else can I say about Daniel's place?"" and he was like, ""OH MAN!  It's one thing to expect breakfast from a B&B, and it's quite another to be chez Daniel.  His command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched."""
2818,35916.0,4/16/2010,97200,Ludovic,"It's the perfect place: clean, safe, noiseless, with a perfect owner.  Moreover with the hash from Island, we were stucked in amstedam and daniel help us a lot. So thanks you Daniel. If you have to come to Amsterdam, choose the Daniel's place and you will enjoy your holidays."
2818,36774.0,4/19/2010,103149,Faisal,"When you reach at Dainel place, be sure that all things are ready to greet you. May it be meticulously made room or spick & span bathroom or well-thought-of information on ""Things To Do"" along with relevant maps & transportation schedule to explore the city to the fullest. Nothing misses out from Daniel's radar.<br/>His pleasing personality with great asthetic sense is just an icing on the cake.We would definately stay with him again.Thanks again for making us feel at home."
2818,39856.0,5/3/2010,112391,Rickey,"Daniel is a terrific host, like one of the other people stated Danile provided me with great maps and recommendations. I would stay with Daniel again anytime. "
2818,45708.0,5/24/2010,79479,David,Daniel was a fantastic host and we would absolutely stay again with him. Everything was as advertised and you can easily get anywhere from his apartment. 
2818,48766.0,6/1/2010,99878,Josh,"Our stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of mine and my partner's whirlwind European tour. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think Zen), but having Daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. <br/><br/>The room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. We were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes Daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.<br/><br/>I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. As a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming. <br/><br/>P.S. You can check my YouTube page for videos of our stay in Amsterdam, which includes a peek into the room: (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
2818,54108.0,6/17/2010,131821,Amelia,"Daniel was very accomodating and friendly. It was a little pricey for what it was. The bed was smaller than a dormitory bed, and as a college student, I would know. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe but I did get hassled a few times outside of the apartment. Overall, I was impressed but I probably would stay closer to the city center in the future."
2818,54654.0,6/19/2010,97097,Jenn,Daniel's place was great! We got so much relaxing in. We loved staying there are really appreciated his great hospitality! He gave us great tips on getting around etc. I would recommend his place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam.
2818,58048.0,6/27/2010,147769,Andrew,"Just a short note - my first experience with AirBnB was with Daniel and it was stellar.  Exactly as indicated and advertised, the service was exemplary.  As a person who does a lot of business travelling, I found Daniel to be an informed and professional host.  Much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  I highly recommend Daniel to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam, the experience was completely positive."
2818,62552.0,7/8/2010,15745,David,"Daniel was an exceptional host!  I was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:<br/><br/>1) Friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- Along with my reservation I received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at Daniel's doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).<br/><br/>2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel's apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.<br/><br/>3) All the ""little extras"" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.  Everything was well thought-out and Daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb."
2818,73222.0,8/3/2010,164729,Michel,"Daniel is a great host. He is a very sweet and courteous person and he seems to truly enjoy hosting guests. His apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). He provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that I can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. Daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him.<br/>Thank you Daniel."
2818,74084.0,8/5/2010,171625,Lezle,"We spent two nights at Daniel's and very much enjoyed it. Early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. The room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. His place is a bit out of the central area of Amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. It was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. We would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!"
515749,6102263.0,7/30/2013,72642,Will,Great communication by Derk he was quick to respond with any inquiries. The houseboat was really quite large with plenty of room. The bed is very comfortable. The location is very close to the museums however you are a tram ride to the station and some of the main areas of Amsterdam. However their are several tram stops just minutes away from the place.  Highly recommended. 
515749,6150839.0,8/1/2013,4154919,Ty,"Derk's houseboat is the absolute best place to stay in Amsterdam. There's no better way to experience the city than by staying on the end of a quiet canal in a great area, surrounded by restaurants and walking distance to the museums. The houseboat is spacious and comes with all the comforts of home with the added addition of being able to sit up on deck and take in the canal life. Derk was a great host, going over the quirks of the accommodations and surrounding area with us. Can't wait to come back to Amsterdam and stay here again."
515749,6297784.0,8/7/2013,465033,Maarit,"A wonderful place to stay in Amsterdam. We enjoyed the location, quiet but so close to many nice areas to wonder in and eat at. We had a great time and enjoyed relaxing on the boat!"
515749,6373581.0,8/10/2013,1535004,Eleanor,"What a beautiful place to stay!  Really, do stay here if you possibly can - it is a wonderful, spacious boat - plenty of room for two or three people - and on a beautiful canal - a perfect base for exploring Amsterdam. Easy to get to from the center of the city, and a pleasant walk away from the big museums. Derk was very friendly and helpful, even when our flight got in early - a wonderful host! "
785432,3301352.0,1/7/2013,2231747,Lucie & Max,"Wonderful place to stay in the very center of Amsterdam, the house boat is just perfect, cosy and well equiped. You can see the Hermitage Museum and the City hall from the window. We were here in January so we couldn't really enjoy the roof top, it is surely very pleasant in summer time. Daan was very kind and help us with the car, gave us good advice and tips about the city. He was always availlable to help. Thanx a lot truly for these fews days in Amsterdam, on a Houseboat !"
785432,3437158.0,1/29/2013,4578307,Silvia,"It has been amazing to spend a week end in Amsterdam sleeping on a houseboat: a unique experience! <br/>The place is very nice and cosy, the host very kind and always availlable for anything you need. <br/>The boat is really in the heart of the city, a very pretty neighbourhood full of restaurants, bars and shops. Also, the Metro station makes very easy to reach the Central Station and the Airport.<br/>I will definitely come back!!"
2818,87063.0,8/30/2010,175043,Andrew,"Daniel was an excellent host, and I whole heartedly recommend his accomodations. He is pleasant, the place was very clean, and the location was perfect - a 10-15 minute bus or metro ride to downtown and quiet in the evening. On my next visit to Amsterdam, I would absolutely stay with Daniel again. "
2818,91025.0,9/6/2010,105289,Nadia,Daniel is a fantastic host who cares about the details of his guest's stay in Amsterdam. He was a blessing when it came to getting directions of where we needed to go. He definitely comes excellently-recommended!

785432,3574220.0,2/18/2013,2421794,Marat,"Our experience was amazing! In first, the boat is located in perfect place, near subway and moorings of most popular touristic boat lines. It is really center of Amsterdam. Next advantage is facilities on the boat. At morning you can make a cup of coffee and enjoy it on the boat stern looking at canal and nice buildings and bridge. And finally, just in a few hours you'll have great skill of entering inside boat through the small door :-)"
785432,3614980.0,2/26/2013,4572050,Barbara,"We've been 4 days on the fantastic houseboat - I only can highly recommend it... As from the beginning with making the reservation, through e-mailing back and forth for clearing details etc. and finally leaving the boat at the end of our stay - everything worked out perfectly. We loved the attitude, the welcoming atmosphere and the caring, we felt from Daan throughout the whole time... Even got a hairdryer shortly of our stay at his boat... <br/>All I can say: we are coming back as soon as possible - the next time preferably in spring or summer to take advantage of the terrace for seizing evening time... <br/>Thanks a lot for everything and cu soon again in beautiful AMS-city - with these great shops, restaurants and the Stadthaus (Theatre and Operahouse) just some meters away from the boat... Barbara"

785432,3744031.0,3/11/2013,983934,Andrea,"Daan was a super friendly and helpful host. He was very quick to reply to my messages before arrival and also very reliable during the trip.<br/>He had answers to all our questions and adviced us well. Following his recommendation we went to a very nice bar, we would never have found otherwise.<br/>The boat itself is wonderful, as is the location. <br/>It's clean, quite and very comfortable and you reach everything in the city in 10 minutes.<br/>We would go back to stay at Daan's houseboat as soon as we get a chance to. I can highly recommend this place!"

785432,3927466.0,3/28/2013,1144382,Maya,"Daan's houseboat was wonderful--GREAT location, clean, completely outfitted for everything you would need, and a lovely rooftop patio for warmer evenings or morning coffee. A fully equipped kitchen allowed us to pick up fresh pasteries, yogurt nd fruit for simple, quick and delicious breakfasts. Daan was incredibly responsive in advance of our arrival, sending great directions and accommodating our early check-in. He also gave us excellent recommendations for dinner both nights that we were there. Highly recommended for a true Amsterdam canal experience."
785432,3944667.0,3/29/2013,1986682,Thad,"Daan's Houseboat was a treat to stay on. Not only was the boat tidy and comfortable, the location and ambiance was spot on. Daan gave a thorough introduction to staying aboard and was a pleasure to meet.<br/>Our group of five was very satisfied with the evening. I look forward to  staying here again."
785432,3954478.0,3/30/2013,5560745,Jeroen,"Leuke boot, hele centrale ligging in Amsterdam (Metro Waterlooplein). Schoon en compleet. Eigenaar is flexibel en relaxed."
785432,4024160.0,4/3/2013,5347016,Chris,"Daan was a great host - helpful and very friendly, which gave us a good impression about the city to start with. <br/><br/>The boat was very spacious, well equipped and amazingly quiet, given there were so much going on outside on the river. There were enough rooms for our group of four adults and two kids. The owner even provided a great collection of DVD titles in his boat so you could always keep yourself entertained. All of us enjoyed the stay very much (my son kept asking me ""when can we go back to our boat?"" when we did our sight seeing there). <br/><br/>The location of the boathouse, as the name indicates, is so central that you are virtually within walking distances to many attractions, Rembrandt House Museum, Heritage Amsterdam (where Van Gogh was exhibited until the end of Apr 2013), Handbags and Purses Museum (the one and only in the world) and many others. I had my best coffee of the trip at a corner coffee shop (Puccini) about 5 min away and the restaurant opposite was equally brilliant (Frenzi)."
785432,4041199.0,4/5/2013,1484609,Andrea,"We stayed two nights with our three teenage boys at Daan's boat. The boat is brilliant - spacious, perfectly located, equiped with everything you might need, clean and comfortable. We even prefered staying in for the meals to going to a restaurant because being on the boat was such a great fun. Daan is really friendly and very helpful. We had a perfect stay and hope to come back soon. "
785432,4230988.0,4/21/2013,4654565,Pat,My family (5 adults and a 3 y/o child) and I had a great time on Daan's houseboat! The houseboat  was a conveniently located and supplied all that we needed. The accomodations are clean and comfortable.  Daan was helpful and friendly.  Being directly on the canal offered us a very unique experience.  Loved it!
785432,4267882.0,4/23/2013,5280762,Sinead,"Myself and three friends stayed on Daan's boat for two nights and we had a great experience. We did not want to leave the boat.: ) It was lovely to be able to sit up on top and watch all the boats going by on the canal. The boat itself was very spacious and very well equipped with everything we could possibly need. The location is really good - only a minute from the metro and there is a bike hire shop a few minutes away. <br/>We found Daan to be very friendly and helpful in suggesting ideas for our stay in Amsterdam. <br/>We would highly recommend staying on this boat and hope that we will be back at some stage in the future. "
785432,4290349.0,4/25/2013,5124445,Kathleen,We had a wonderful and unique experience staying in Daan's houseboat in Amsterdam. The boat was comfortable and located in a fantastic location near many bars and cafes. It was great to stay on the water and wake up to such a beautiful view!
785432,4321026.0,4/28/2013,4752867,Cristina,Thanks Daan for making us welcome! Staying in an housboat in Amsterdam was a wonderful experience and we suggest everybody to do the same by you! 
785432,4426860.0,5/5/2013,3919221,Anna&Paul,"If you are looking for an original place to stay, this houseboat is the good plan! Very comfy and in the center of the city, you will find everything needed on this floating flat. Daan is very helpful and welcoming, don't hesitate! "
785432,4469491.0,5/7/2013,4722770,Margarita,"The Houseboat was great and if opportunity presents itself, I would repeat the experience.  There was, however, miscommunication between the Owner and a person who was to check us in, which resulted in a bit of panic and lost time."
785432,4610646.0,5/15/2013,565006,Amy,"Daan and his wife were great hosts. The boat is really cute with a great bathtub and a very comfy bed (and good, fast, free wifi). It was fun to see the other tourists going by on tour boats, taking pictures of me on Daan's boat because they thought I was the real deal. The location is excellent - within a five minute walk of several excellent Indonesian restaurants. All in all, a great way to experience Amsterdam. "
515749,6417228.0,8/12/2013,3917544,Martine,"Belle expérience originale , le bateau est très bien placé pour le quartier des musées et les restaurants proches.<br/>Derk est quelqu'un de fort sympathique et dévoué ."
515749,6484938.0,8/14/2013,4129141,Baine,"This was fantastic!  Derk's houseboat was comfortable, perfectly-located, and fun.  Can't think of a better place to stay in Amsterdam.  And Derk was friendly and accommodated our late arrival, which was great.  Hope to go back for a longer time soon!  "
515749,6595696.0,8/18/2013,7745769,Kelly,"Charming houseboat with a great location. We enjoyed a two night stay, it was quiet and cosy and Derk gave us a lovely welcome. He was also very helpful in sorting out a small problem with the boat and loaning us a iphone charger. Overall a great guy! The houseboat is in a residential street so it was quiet, but close to transport and shops. We had some lovely evenings sitting out on the deck picnicking and watching the world go by. Look for the Albert Heijn supermarket near the corner of Utrecht Straat and Frederiks Plein and the Dirk supermarket in Marie Heineken Plein. Also De Carosel restaurant on Weteringplantsoen makes wonderful pancakes and poffertjies. And on Vijzelgracht go to Holtkamp bakery for appletart and freshly prepared kroketten. It is also a short walk to the newly opened Rijksmuseum. Buy tickets online and arrive shortly before it opens at 9:00 to miss the worst of the crowds and go see The Night Watch by Rembrant first. So enjoyed Amsterdam, great city."
515749,6777413.0,8/25/2013,5415727,Christophe,"Derk let us have an environment where you will feel quickly as the maison.Une great experience.<br/>The place is quiet and very well placed. we stayed for a week<br/><br/>Thank you Derk"
2818,94243.0,9/10/2010,202035,Agam,"Daniel's setup was very good.  Like other reviewers have said before, he has a lot of nice little touches and everything is extremely well thought out in providing a seamless experience for his guests.  <br/><br/>Daniel himself was really nice and accommodating.  He helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.<br/><br/>His place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  Also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  So it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.<br/><br/>There are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  Would definitely stay there agin."
2818,97728.0,9/15/2010,211004,Alexandra,"Our stay at Daniel was awesome. He has a beautiful flat which is very tidy and neat. The room to rent is also very nice. It has two comfy beds and a wardrobe. Daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. There are also towels for which Daniel provides a special space in the bathroom. <br/>What was outstanding, was that Daniel also lent us two of his bikes. This was most helpful as we hadn't to figure out the public transport and were free to discover Amsterdam by bike. Even if you would have to take the bus or tram the appartment is located idealy to various stops. "
2818,105516.0,9/26/2010,217961,Sam,"my stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of of my visit to amsterdam. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable , but having Daniel as a point of reference was my key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever i had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. The room is located at quite 15 minut from the heart of the city, but i didn't find this hindering. i was able to get to the center in 15 minut. also the bus stop is only 3 minut walk from the house . There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living. I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels.definetly will be goin there again thank you daniel so much for everything u done for me to make my stay very confortable..  <br/><br/>"
515749,6845389.0,8/27/2013,6578543,Dominique,"Very pleasant experience in quiet and lovely place.<br/>Thanks Derk for your kindness.<br/>Hope come back soon !"
515749,7299328.0,9/15/2013,5923442,Gary,"September 2013<br/>We stayed 5 nights on Derk's houseboat. He met us for an early check-in after our 7 hour flight from Canada and was most welcoming and helpful giving us advice on what was available in the area. The houseboat was warm and comfortable on a quiet canal away from the busy ""touristy"" area. This was our first stay with Airbnb and we were very pleased with the experience."
515749,7360044.0,9/17/2013,3594917,Cailey,"Derk's houseboat was lovely! Although we did not get a chance to meet it was very easy to correspond and we had an amazing time. Very cozy bed, next to the tram and walking distance to everything we needed. Location could not be beat! Thanks so much for hosting us Derk!"
785432,4645700.0,5/18/2013,5171993,Ed,"Superb location on the Amstel near to Rembrandtplein and plenty more bars, cafes and restaurants nearby, as well as being very close to the metro and tram.<br/>Excellent laidback host - we didn't arrive until 10pm but this wasn't a problem and he lives close by in case of any emergencies. He was also a good source of knowledge of the surrounding area.<br/>The houseboat had plenty of room for the four of us with pretty much everything you'd require on a short stay catered for.<br/>Overall highly recommended!!!"
785432,4724696.0,5/22/2013,2406987,Felix,Excellent host... Very helpfull. Excellent location... The best

Everything else is about 15min away by foot. The rooftop terrace is lovely on sunny days: we luckily had one evening to test it :) I'll definetly be back here when  I'll travel to Amsterdam with a group of more than 3 people, the experience on a houseboat is simply unique ;) and Daan is so easy going, you'll love him.<br/><br/>Thanks again Daan & tot ziens! ^.^"
785432,4843514.0,5/28/2013,6280091,Tim,"Booking was easy with Daan.  I texted him once we landed at Schipol and he met us at the boat.   The house boat was excellent.  Plenty of room and very well located.  We really enjoyed sipping coffee on the upper deck and waving at all the tour boats going by.  I think my kids will now be in several hundred photo albums, probably labeled ""friendly local kids yelling 'hallo' to everyone"".  When we go back to Amsterdam, we hope to stay here again."
785432,4864429.0,5/29/2013,6224166,Andrew,"Had a great time, sitting on the boat in the sun, watching all the boats sail by is fabulous. Daan is a great host, wish we could have stayed longer."
785432,4886186.0,5/31/2013,4227011,George,"Top location,very convenient to everywhere in Amsterdam,spacious in houseboat,Daan is very helpful. Good kitchen equipment and dining space,I thought it will be some noise at night,but it is very quite as even I could not hear any boat and track noise at all.Very special experience on my life,high recommended people to try,worth the try.<br/>George from Melbourne Australia"
785432,5006419.0,6/7/2013,2859136,Mark,"Daan was a fantastic host and made the whole process easy. He also gave us some great restaurant recommendations, all of which we tried. The boat is situated on the south end of Nieuwmarkt on the Amstel canal, it's minutes from all the major sections of the city. The boat itself was great, lots of space and and it is the outside boat so you can relax and watch the drunk boats sail by on the canal. The boat comes with a full kitchen, internet and even air conditioning. A great experience, we would definitely use this boat again."
785432,5076583.0,6/11/2013,2352810,Ionut,"Daan is a great host.<br/><br/>He helped us with the check in and the check out. Living on a boat is la little different that on a house, and there ar some rules that you should comply. These rules are very simple and Daan explains them to you at the beginning. If you listen to him carefully, everything it will be ok. We didn't. But we managed it, we agreed with Daan and in the end it was ok. I hope he will receive us next time as well. :)<br/><br/>It is my second time in Amsterdam, but the first time staying on a boat. It is a totally different experience. Everybody should try it at least once. And Daan's boat is very close to everything. We rented some bikes and everything was 10-15 minutes away. The boat is like in the pictures and the description. If you get sea sick, do not wary. I do too, but in this kind of boat, I had no problems :) We staid 4 people in 2 beds, but it fits 6 people without problems (there ate 2 sofas that could be used).<br/><br/>I repeat myself: If you ar going to Amsterdam, living on a boat is a must have experince, and Daan's boat is very well suited for it:) <br/>"
785432,5307110.0,6/24/2013,5035178,Rune,"As a first time user of Airbnb I was a bit worried about this trip. Daan made the worries disappear. He was quick to reply to my questions, and made clear agreements prior to our visit. One in Amsterdam he was very friendly, answered our questions and gave us good advice. The houseboat was clean and above expectations. It was such a blast sitting on the deck watching boats passing by. The boat is in close proximity and any kind of good times, but at the same time shielded from noise. Will be back on the boat on my next trip to Amsterdam for sure."
785432,5339540.0,6/25/2013,3859903,Carmen,"Definitely would have liked to stay longer - great communication, excellent location and view."
785432,5447444.0,7/1/2013,5155652,Ulrike,"Daan is a very friendly and nice host. The boat was nearly perfect. The location is absolutely fabulous, the boat was clean, just the two fold out beds are a bit tiny for two grown ups (especially man ;)). For a couple it should´t be a problem at all.<br/>We had everything on the boat we needed and really enjoyed our time in Amsterdam.<br/>We could even leave our luggage at Daans place since we had to get out of the boat but still wanted to go for a coffee. <br/>Highly recommended!"
785432,5565466.0,7/6/2013,1418656,Hester,"We were 5 family members coming from 3 different places and this was a great option for us to be together. Make sure you check out exact address/location with Daan because (Hidden by Airbnb) maps did not locate it very exactly. You do have to walk over another boat to get to the entrance. The houseboat experience was super fun, especially sitting on the deck and watching Amsterdam life go by (tugboats, tourist boats, skullers, small boats, happy hour boats .....). And enjoying the sway of the boat and looking out the windows at boats passing so close that we said hello. Music theatre across street. AH super market and Waterlooplein flea market nearby. Not especially quiet because of the bustle, but not too bad noise wise (except first night a few rowdy street partyers)<br/>The shower door was not working very well, but we managed and we didn't use the tub for environmental reasons (too much water use). The kitchen area was great and 2 rooms were private the third bed is in the main room area, which worked for us.<br/>Daan is a very relaxed and flexible host. I would recommend<br/> this to anyone who wants a fun experience , especially with a group of friends/family.<br/>"
2818,112271.0,10/5/2010,227259,Diana,"Daniel makes his guests feel completely welcome,  he checks in to make sure you are having a great time and if you need anything further. He is always available by phone. The room is well appointed with maps and information to get you around the Amsterdam seamlessly.  The room is nicely decorated and very clean with a armoire for your clothes so you don't need to live out of your suitcase. I would definitely stay at Daniel's again.  I had a great time."

2818,194298.0,3/7/2011,374779,Drew,"Daniel's place is a fantastic place to stay in Amsterdam if you expect to be spending (as you should) most or all of your time out and about in the city. It's particularly well-suited to the solo traveller and Daniel is a fantastic host. <br/><br/>Slightly outside the 'core' of Amsterdam, but transport is extremely convenient and Daniel is hugely accommodating with late-night schedules. <br/><br/>Only thing I'd say is that it is best if you have experienced what European apartments are actually like. Daniel's is really, really nice - but it IS European. If you're fresh off the plane from North America and have never been to Europe before I'd suggest you get a hotel for a few days first. But I'd say that about any European apartment. <br/><br/>Hugely enjoyed my time. Highly recommend.  "
2818,196836.0,3/11/2011,422476,Colin,"Staying at Daniel's apartment was great! My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights and were very happy to do so. Daniel was a terrific host who made us feel at home. The room we stayed in was lovely and comfortable, and he provided us with a hair dryer, towels, tea and coffee, maps and guide books. He was a wealth of information in terms of when to go to certain museums, what was and wasn't worthwhile, and the best ways to get around using public transportation. He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight. The location of his apartment is also great--near both train and bus stops, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend staying here! "
2818,214718.0,4/1/2011,442422,Angela,"Daniel's apartment was perfect for my 5 days in Amsterdam (march 2011) and was a great value. It is only 5 minutes away from the bus and is in a safe residential area. The area has public transports, restaurants, laundry, supermarket. The apartment was also very comfortable and very well-equipped. The kitchen, work desk, shower and bathroom were all very nice. It is well maintained, very clean, nicely decorated. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are soft and fragrant. There were beautiful flowers, tea and hot water inside my room. He has an eye for everything, is friendly and very professional. Daniel arranged everything and advised me before the trip. His manager went well beyond to answer my daily questions, taught me how travel around the city, and was nearby most times or quickly responded to my messages.  In short: go to Amsterdam, rent Daniel's appartment and be happy. Thanks again, Daniel for a great stay! Angela (Brazil)."
2818,232163.0,4/19/2011,485490,Aisling,"Great Trip, accomodation was very clean and Daniel was very welcoming and professional. He provides hotel-like accomodation with a real feeling of Amsterdam. Would highly recommend a stay at Daniel's. "

785432,5696026.0,7/12/2013,6762783,Lisa,"We had a great time on Daan's houseboat. He made a good arrangement for us to get the key even though we were later than expected, and he arranged for a taxi to get us to the airport at the end of our stay. This was a great way to experience Amsterdam and the houseboat was conveniently located near the intersection of all of the canal bus routes. Fridge was nicely stocked with useful ingredients, there were useful guides to Amsterdam onboard. Everything worked. Plenty of towels and linen. I would recommend this to couples or families that want to have an authentic experience of Amsterdam"
785432,5747341.0,7/15/2013,1907589,Anna,This was a very nice experience.  Daan is very helpful and available for questions.  Perfect central location.  Our kids were very excited to sleep on a houseboat!
785432,5804696.0,7/17/2013,2060773,Chelsea,We had the most beautiful relaxing holiday staying on Daan's canal boat. Daan took the time to help us settle in and recommend authentic Dutch restaurants. Very comfortable accommodation. Highly recommend..

785432,6144165.0,8/1/2013,4767808,Noel,Ideal canal location in the heart of Amsterdam. Host was extremely helpful throughout the stay with advice on eating shopping. A couple of minor issues were fixed up without delay.
785432,6453809.0,8/13/2013,5398089,David,"Heureux et plaisant voyage dans une ville superbe.<br/>La péniche est confortable, pratique, et surtout idéalement située dans un cadre innoubliable.<br/>Dann, le propriétaire est disponible, toujours là en cas de besoin, prêt à apporter de l'aide, à répondre aux questions et à donner des conseils.<br/>Je le conseillerais donc à des amis ou à des membres de ma famille, sans problème."
785432,6843202.0,8/27/2013,5625222,Sheila,What a fabulous way to visit Amsterdam! The houseboat is spacious and comfortable and conveniently located close to the action without being too noisy. The upper deck was great for morning coffee and evening drinks while enjoying the passing boats of every shape and size. <br/>Daan's a great host with helpful hints of where to go for good food and even helped us by booking our taxi to the airport. He even provided tea and coffee. <br/>We highly recommend a stay on his boat. 
515749,7409901.0,9/19/2013,2727862,Emilio,supero mis espectativas. el barco contaba con todo lo necesario. ubicado en un hermoso canal lleno de patos!
515749,7597553.0,9/26/2013,4668309,Beverly,"Derk is an excellent host, he was there to meet us and gave us lots of guidance. The houseboat is rustic, the bed comfortable , everything works well, and the location decent. It's about a 15 minute walk to the Rijks Museum and Van Gogh Gallery.  And, best of all, it's a block from the tram that goes directly to and from the train station. "
515749,7766531.0,10/2/2013,172664,John,"Derk's houseboat is a great place to stay and Derk is a fine host. The location was perfect for us - a 10 minutes walk to the Rijksmuseum. Derk plays in one of Amsterdam's fine orchestras, and he got us inexpensive tickets to a wonderful concert. We will stay on his boat again when we return."
515749,7958821.0,10/10/2013,2262959,Tero,"Derk was a great, very active host. The houseboat itself was exactly what I expected regarding the amenities and the location could not have been better, basically walking distance from everything important downtown (eg. Rijksmuseum). Also, I was really surprised how peaceful the surroundings were, considering how central the location is. We are definitely going to book this again when we return to Amsterdam."
515749,7999576.0,10/12/2013,1759329,Jesper,We had a great stay at Derks lovely and autentic houseboat. Nice and cosy location.

It is in located in a quiet street and in a walking distance from most places. Derk was very kind and gave us a lot of information about the city. We would certainly stay there again! 
515749,8149373.0,10/18/2013,5144287,Kirsten,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on Derk's houseboat. Very comfortable and homely - and moored in a quiet, picturesque and convenient location. Derk was a perfect host. He gave us a warm welcome and supplied us with all the information we needed. In particular, Derk really went out of his way to help us when an emergency situation which had nothing to do with the accommodation arose - and everything was 'fixed' :-). Thank you very much, Derk! We fully recommend the genuine Amsterdam experience of staying on Derk's houseboat - and will make an extra effort not to create too much 'trouble' when we return one day ;-)"
2818,260298.0,5/12/2011,229991,Marsha,"Daniel is an amazing host!  The room is exceptionally comfortable, very good mattresses, very pretty, light and airy.  There is a tea service area with a small fridge that was very convenient.  The environment was exceptionally clean, organized and Daniel has maps and a wealth of information available for tourists.  He was great at helping us to make arrangements for tourist tickets online.  The most wonderful thing about his location is the neighborhood, especially if you are looking for a local experience.  It was very easy to use the public transit system from his location.  Everything is close.  Daniel offered bikes to use and that was fabulous.  Daniel did everything possible to provide a pleasant experience and we had an amazing time.  I highly recommend Daniel's place.  "
2818,314616.0,6/14/2011,636413,Sabine,We spent  a few day by Daniel. We have a very good accomotion. Daniel is very kind and busy man for his guest. We will come back to Amsterdam and defently go to Daniel. 
2818,330647.0,6/23/2011,668411,Marcia,"Daniel is a welcoming and accommodating host who is interesting to talk with. The room is attractive and very comfortable. The location is not far by public transport from anything that you might want to do in Amsterdam. Don't hesitate to ask Daniel questions about things to do, how to get there, and especially places to eat. His recommendations are excellent!<br/><br/>We loved our stay in Amsterdam and would gladly stay with Daniel again."
2818,341388.0,6/28/2011,711463,Sunny,"Daniel is a very kind, helpful, and nice host. We were amazed at his careful attention at every detail for the guests. Everything was very clean as a nice hotel. The room is so cozy and bright, you can even see a nice little garden from the window. <br/><br/>We did not plan much for this trip, but on the first night we could perfectly plan out everything with the resources Daniel provided us. All the travel guides and efficient maps are in the room! <br/><br/>If you a big fan of Thai food, ask Daniel where to go for your first meal in Amsterdam near his place- it was THE BEST. <br/><br/>Thank you Daniel!!!<br/>Sunny K"

515749,8522062.0,11/4/2013,8777143,Jean-Marie,"Très belle péniche dans un quartier calme d'Amsterdam… Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour à Amsterdam. Derk est très sympathique et serviable.<br/>Bref… A refaire !"
515749,8897927.0,11/25/2013,8948064,Michael,"Das Hausboot ist sehr gemütlich, überraschend hell durch die Deckenlichter und wurde durch die Gasheizung sehr schnell warm - auch im kalten November. Außerdem ist das Hausboot für 2 Personen sehr geräumig. <br/><br/>Es ist sehr ruhig gelegen und trotzdem nur 5 bis 10 Minuten zu Fuß vom Altstadt-Zentrum von Amsterdam entfernt.<br/><br/>Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt - vielen Dank, Derk!<br/><br/>Sehr zu empfehlen!"
515749,8958059.0,11/28/2013,9678717,Christopher,Derk's houseboat is fantastic and located on a beautiful and quiet canal that's still close to everything. He was very helpful and our arrival and departure were smooth and easy. 
515749,9057232.0,12/3/2013,3097746,Denis,"We definitely liked our stay in Amsterdam on Derk's houseboat! It was great experience. Derk was very nice and hospitable, he advised us some nice local cafes and bars. The boat itself is very cosy and comfortable. It is located on quite canal so you won't be disturbed by crowds of tourists and could have some privacy, but if you want to go to some central streets it takes about 5-10 minutes by foot. We enjoyed our weekend in Amsterdam very much thanks to Derk and his beautiful boat."
515749,9225153.0,12/15/2013,1855886,Julie,"My husband and I stayed at Derk's boat for three days in December and absolutely loved it! We found the place spotless, with all the necessary amenities (good coffee maker, hot shower, great bed, wifi.. etc.). We felt at home right away and couldn't get enough of the views from the boat onto our peaceful canal... I mean, you can see the towers of the Rijksmuseum from it - you cannot beat that! <br/>It is a great place to explore Amsterdam. There are tram stops close by, a grocery store 5 minutes away, nice cafés and bars close by too. Derk is a great host, easy to communicate with and very accommodating. This is a very special place to stay in and I highly recommend it."
515749,9295115.0,12/19/2013,9257120,Grant,"Such a fun and awesome place to stay in Amsterdam. Thoroughly enjoyed myself. <br/><br/>The houseboat has everything you could need, and was deliciously warm and cosy in winter. Very well located, central, in a picturesque part of town.<br/><br/>Desk was a great host, gave a thorough introduction to not only the accommodation, but also the city itself....even when I arrived quite late at night.<br/><br/>Thanks for an amazing experience!"
515749,9494779.0,12/31/2013,1114174,Jake And Cristine,"Derk was an excellent host and the boathouse was perfect. Charming place that's conveniently located. We would do it again in a heartbeat. Thanks, Derk!"

515749,11057902.0,3/18/2014,12607062,Susanne,Wunderschönes Hausboot und auch noch in einer Top-Lage! Wir haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt und würden jederzeit wiederkommen. 
515749,11154170.0,3/23/2014,10277981,Lesley,Derek was a great host! The ship was a great way to see Amsterdam. Derek was very friendly and gave us great advice about where to go in the city. I would recommend his ship to anyone. 
515749,11357907.0,3/31/2014,12546371,Ulf,Wonderful! Perfect Location and perfect host!

515749,11483904.0,4/5/2014,8744260,Suzanna,"We stayed on Derk's boat for two nights and absolutely loved it. The boat is easy to get to by bus from the main train station and right near all manner of shops and sights. It was very spacious and comfortable, and was almost more like an apartment than a boat. I was a little worried about the toilet/shower situation beforehand (from other boat experiences) but they worked great! Derk was also easy to get ahold of and flexible with our  travel schedule. I would highly recommend this place! "
515749,11536244.0,4/7/2014,11690130,Stacie,"Derk's houseboat was fantastic! When we first arrived, Derk was there to greet us and provide helpful tips about the city. I couldn't have imagined a better place to stay for our weekend away in Amsterdam. "
515749,11693741.0,4/12/2014,1412783,Steven,"Booked a two night stay which turned out to have been double booked by airbnb.<br/>Derk handled it perfectly by providing us a different boat for each night at the same location. Would definitely recommand staying here."
515749,11733440.0,4/14/2014,5324567,Ben,"A cute house boat on a cute quiet canal. My favorite moment of the trip was waking up in the morning and having coffee outside on the boat, watching the ducks play in the canal and the view of the Rijksmuseum in the distance. Tip: It's much cheaper to take a tram from Centraal Station than a taxi. Derk was a great host, and very attentive to what we needed!"
785432,6909963.0,8/30/2013,1782511,Ralf,"Awesome place to be. Even people living in Amsterdam are jealous of this houseboat, since there are only about 2500 of them on the Grachten. It's quiet and on a sunny evening you're basicly the king of the world sitting on your houseboat-terrace until the sun sets. Daan is someone who knows his way around amsterdam, he can practically tell you anything and knows where to go. We had a great time, and will be back for sure."
785432,7032142.0,9/4/2013,2628722,Craig,We had a great time. Daan was a wonderful host. When we first arrived it was night and we were so confused by the quaint narrow roads. Dan gave turn by turn directions by cell phone and was standing in front waving when we got there.  No better way to visit Amsterdam then a stay on a houseboat. Daan's place is comfortable and well appointed. It is within easy walking distance of major museums & attractions. Daan also told us about a wonderful place for breakfast. Only regret is we couldn't stay longer. 
785432,7189906.0,9/10/2013,3339671,Ruggero,"The Houseboat is an experience: a perfect place to enjoy Amsterdam. Was amazing to be there for our group of friends, and Daan made everything possible to make us feel more than welcome. The house is cozy and right in the center, everything is in walking distance and the terrace is an incredible place to enjoy the time and have a drink.<br/>A dream!"
785432,7237823.0,9/13/2013,6243399,Emily,"The absolute perfect way to experience Amsterdam. This houseboat is truly in the best possible location for visiting Amsterdam. Near everything! We were so happy we found this listing.<br/><br/>The boat was super clean and modern and so comfortable. The shower was even fantastic! <br/><br/>Daan was an awesome host. He showed us everything, but then trusted us during our whole stay and we were never bothered.<br/><br/>ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. A gem of a place.<br/><br/>Just look for the house number when trying to find it. We walked past it a few times. <br/><br/>Highly recommend. Thanks, Daan for everything!"
785432,7322406.0,9/16/2013,5574324,Signe,"Everything was as agreed, fine and cool! "
785432,7383818.0,9/17/2013,697222,Rand,"Daan and his houseboat experience is entirely easy and very accomodating. The best way to spend some time in Amsterdam, on the water like that<br/>"
785432,7431048.0,9/20/2013,5116032,Kate,"We had such a wonderful time on Daan's Houseboat.  The location is amazing and it felt really special after 3 weeks of hotels to step on and off a boat.<br/>Daan met us on the first day and gave us a tour of the boat and made sure that we were happy to ask any questions during our stay there.  After that we didn't see him until we checked out but knew he was right there if we needed him.<br/>The boat is really well equipped and the attention to detail is lovely.  <br/><br/>Really great.  Highly recommended!<br/>"
785432,7466449.0,9/21/2013,2550926,Alana,"Not only was staying on a houseboat a novel way to experience Amsterdam, the location was perfect as were the amenities.  Daan was very helpful and happy to offer tourism advice.  The houseboat interior was new, clean and contained all necessary items for a holiday - clean towels, toaster, kettle with tea and coffee, kitchenware and lots of extra bedding. I couldn't recommend staying here highly enough!"
785432,7620924.0,9/27/2013,7619732,Roy,"Thank you Daan for an  unforgettable stay in a truely amazing city.<br/>We had 4 adults and 2 kids and everone had an amazing time with plenty of space for all on the boat.<br/>This is the perfect accommodation in the perfect location and I have already promised several friends I will show them this beautiful city from this spot! <br/>"
785432,7783053.0,10/2/2013,6933730,James,Lovely boat in a great central location. Thanks Daan!
785432,7825144.0,10/5/2013,6421277,Rohan,"Daan's boat is very centrally located. We stayed with three small children (9,4 and 2) and there were no issues with safety at all. The boat could accommodate up to 4 single adults or three couples, but the beds would be a bit tight for the latter. The facilities were very good and given its excellent location, it was still relatively quiet at night time. There is also very good access to the tram network from the boat with the No. 14 going straight to the Westermarkt and Anne Frank Huis and a little further long nearer to the Muntplein (perhaps a 10 minute walk) the No. 16 goes directly to the Museumplein (in behind the Rijksmuseum, Steedelijk Museum and van Gogh Museum). There are several restaurants and eateries in the neighbourhood, with the Rembrantplein only a 5 minute walk away. However, with the good access to the trams virtually on the front door step, you can safely venture further a field and eat in other parts of the city and still get home in comfort as we did a couple of times. Daan also helped to arrange an excellent taxi driver who drove us to the airport at Schiphol for around 45 Euros in  morning traffic. The driver was punctual, drove safely and his vehicle was also very clean.We would recommend Daan's boat as houseboats are quintessentially an Amsterdam icon and a really cool way to stay in a fabulous city!"
785432,7912433.0,10/8/2013,3985795,Markus,Bei Daan in Amsterdam hat alles Bestens geklappt. Wir haben die Zeit auf und im Boot genossen. Das schlafen ist sehr entspannt und auch ruhig. Gerne ein anderes Mal wieder. Markus und Andrea
785432,7965650.0,10/10/2013,4638959,Babs,Nice and quite boat in the centre of Amsterdam with all the stuff you need. I really appreciated the coffee and tea  who were available. We stayed there with 5 adults (not couples) and some beds were maybe quite small but okay. Daan was very flexible to meet and hand the keys and to help with all special needs from my colleagues :-)...
785432,8002193.0,10/12/2013,8698082,Elisha,The houseboat was amazing!!!! Daan was so great and told us all the local pubs to get a great feed and a cold beer! The houseboat was so beautiful just sitting and enjoying all the boats go by. 10/10
2818,359800.0,7/8/2011,400176,Sharon,"Daniel is a phenomenal host; he has everything you could need and has an answer for every question we had.  The room is better than the photo and the accomodations were wonderful.  Daniel was great with communication both before and during our stay.  The location has easy access to tram, bus, stores, restaurants, and pubs - all within walking distance. I will definitely stay with Daniel again and I have already recommended his room to family and friends."
2818,369637.0,7/12/2011,772352,David,"Daniel is an outstanding host. He is extraordinarily organized & tidy. The room was spotless, and the two beds were comfortable. There is quite a lot of space, and a beautiful view of his backyard garden out the bedroom window. It is so nice to open the windows and see greenery and hear the chirping birds. It is an easy 10-15 minute bike ride to Amsterdam Centraal Station, and all the rest that the city has to offer. Highly recommended! I would definitely stay again."
2818,510827.0,9/7/2011,909454,Yana,"Daniels's place is really fantastic and he was a great host! <br/><br/>His place is beautifully decorated and very clean and no detail is lost to the make the stay very comfortable for his guests. From the latest cover of ""time out amsterdam"" to color coded towel rack for guests, to the most comfortable beds and pillows, latest travel books,  keys for each guest, his place set a high standard of what Airbnb should be like.<br/><br/>Especially grateful for countless hours Daniel put into helping my travel parner with her lost passport/wallet in another country, and having a converter for my mac.<br/><br/>His home was quiet and peaceful, and he has a lovely garden. The bus is a block away, supermarket 2 blocks away, and a great restaurant Bahnus(?) is 2-3 blocks away, serves very good dinner.<br/><br/>Highly recommend his home for exploring Amsterdam. There is a park  about 20 minutes away that's a must see for a flower lover, it's called Oosterpark and it was delightful!"
2818,515199.0,9/9/2011,801728,Dominic,"Our stay with Daniel was enjoyable - our only complaint was the non-stop-rain during our visit, and really Daniel could have done nothing about this!"
2818,542894.0,9/18/2011,1033494,Franziska,"Daniel is a great host, he is very helpful and he can give you any info about amsterdam you need. The room as well as the bathroom and toilet are very clean. Daniel's place is located 1,4 km away from a park+ride, in a nice neighborhood and is really good connected to the city center.  Highly recommended!"
2818,554817.0,9/21/2011,1119102,Adam,"Daniel was the definition of a fantastic host. His place was impeccable. When we arrived (which was late, and our ETA was changed a few times due to travel woes), our beds were made, clean towels neatly wrapped, soothing music playing, and the smell of fresh eucalyptus/mint filled the air. Overall, a fantastic experience I would recommend to everyone. <br/><br/>Thanks Daniel!<br/>Adam&Jess"
2818,698543.0,11/7/2011,62868,Rachel,"Daniel was an absolute dream host. His place is so clean, he is EXTREMELY organized and super sweet. We had such a great time in Amsterdam and Daniel had a major part of that. I can't tell you how much I recommend staying with him! THANKS DANIEL!!!!!!"
2818,825414.0,1/2/2012,1475799,Dhaval,Daniel is a great host even before reaching AMS he gave us good directions on how to get to his place. Leaving @ Daniels was wonderful. He has a great place in a quiet neighboorhood with easy access to trams and busses to get to the centraal station in 15 mins. On our arrival he shared a lot of good information about places to visit. We had an extra guest at the last minute and he was more than happy to accommodate  him in the living room. AMS is awesome and would definitely like to visit back and would stay @Daniels again :)
2818,1084419.0,4/4/2012,1315953,Miriam,"We felt very much welcomed at Daniel's place. Very thing is well organized, you are provided with eveything you need, the room is pleasant and Daniel is a sensitive and sensible host. It felt a bit like home :-) "
2818,1194128.0,4/28/2012,2133939,Christina,"Daniel was a great host! This was our first time staying in a B&B and let's just say he set the bar really high. His home was extremely clean and very well organized. The garden view was so peaceful. Both my bf and myself were sick during our Europe trip and Daniel was kind enough to offer us lozenges for our sore throats. He was also very helpful by providing maps, magazines on things to do and any other advice we needed. The room came equipped with coffee and tea and WiFi. His home is very close to public transportation and getting to central Amsterdam was a breeze. If I ever come back to Amsterdam I would definitely be staying at his place again. "

Daniel is an exceptional host- he helped us carry our luggage, poured us juice, and gave us so many useful information that made our stay in Amsterdam truly memorable. The room provided a 5* experience and has everything you would possibly need for your stay. The apartment is tastefully decorated with beautiful artwork that is truly inspiring. If you are in Amsterdam, this is the place you should stay. You won't regret it. :)"

From the first moment he welcomed us in a very kindly, respectful and positive way. He provided us information about many places to go and he was always showing us the best alternatives in Amsterdam. At his home everything is perfectly organized and clean, the room is nice, cozy, comfortably, quiet and is located in a nice neighboorhood and very well connected. Definitively Daniel has done everything as possible to make our stay more enjoyable. The place is perfect and highly recommended."

Daniel was very helpful in giving directions on how to best get to his place with a bit of luggage.  On getting there he gave me directions on how best to get to do what I wanted in the time I had.  He provided privacy though I knew he was there to provide any help he could if needed.  I would recommend his place to my friends.  His place is in a very convenient and safe area.  I would definitely look into his place if I had another chance to go to Amsterdam. Thanks, Daniel."

785432,8465872.0,11/1/2013,7184551,Andie,"Our group of 6 had one night in Amsterdam, between a two week safari in East Africa and our return to Canada. As luck would have it, Daan's houseboat was available. The description and pictures are accurate- the beds were comfy and the space was perfect for us to spread out and relax. The roof deck was great and it was such fun to be the creatures on display for passing tour boats! <br/><br/>The location was very central with museums and other attractions anywhere from a 5 to 30 minute walk. My youngest (8 years old) had been nervous about the boat option as she has been seasick in the past- but even though we occasionally felt motion when boats passed by, she was fine and would absolutely go back again.  Next time we will stay longer! <br/><br/>Daan arranged for a cab for us from the airport and since his boat is a couple of doors down, we were confident that he could be reached in any (Website hidden by Airbnb) one point there was an issue with the shower drain, but he fixed it immediately.<br/><br/>In short- if you will be staying in Amsterdam, and have the opportunity to stay on Daan's boat- absolutely give yourself this once-in-a  lifetime treat!"
785432,8483169.0,11/2/2013,9067014,Christine,"Very well-equipped and comfortable houseboat. Not a ""boutique"" decorated boat but functional and spacious enough to accommodate 5 persons without stress.<br/>Very welcoming host<br/>Very centrally located.<br/>A real ""on water"" feeling, yet very quiet and enabling a good sleep"
515749,11770474.0,4/14/2014,13765348,Christophe,Everything perfect. The houseboat is well located to visit Amsterdam downtown and very quiet and pleasant. You can warm the houseboat very quickly. Derk was very helpful and he is a person you can trust.

Right after our arriving he provided us with lots of useful information. the boat itselt is in perfect condition. we walked directly from rhe centraal station since it's a nice way to gain first insights. and it does not take you longer than 15min. <br/>we definitely recommend derk, we enjoyed every minute on the boat. if we ever come back there is a unique place to stay :)"
515749,12145378.0,4/24/2014,864200,Maree,"OMG! Absolute highlight of our month long trip! I had looked at a lot of houseboats, some looked like 5 star hotels but chose this because it had character. I am so glad we did. It was full of character and much more spacious than it looks. The location is fantastic, in a beautiful quiet part of town. On top of that you have Derk the host, what an absolute gem he is. Really helpful, nothing too much trouble. I cannot speak highly enough about the boat and the host. I am trying to organise another trip to Amsterdam as it is now my favourite city, and I would definitely be staying at Derk's place. Thanks Derk, hope to see you soon!!"
515749,12327268.0,4/29/2014,11129120,Gemma,"A fantastic way to have your own private space & comfort right in the middle of the city.  Derk was very relaxed and welcoming & the boat is incredible!  We even found a washing machine under the stairs on day 3, which took me 10 steps closer to convincing my partner that we should live on a boat full time ;-)"
515749,12402937.0,5/1/2014,2830877,Audrey,"Très bien situé dans Amsterdam, tout en restant un endroit paisible. Loger sur cet houseboat permet de déconnecter de la réalité et suffit à embellir votre séjour! "

Idéalement située, dans un quartier tranquille, a 5mn à pied de Rembrandtplain. Tout le centre ville est accessible à pied. <br/>Derk s'est montré accueillant et disponible, en nous donnant des bonnes adresses et en restant joignable sur son téléphone, si besoin est.<br/>S'endormir et se réveiller aux rythmes des clapotis de l'eau, en plein coeur d'Amsterdam, est une expérience incroyable qu'on renouvellera !<br/>"

He arranged for us to get in to the houseboat, even though he could not be there to meet us.  We had no trouble finding it, getting the keys and connecting to wifi before dropping off our stuff and heading out to explore the city.  He came by later to make sure we were okay.  The boat is charming and very spacious!  We were quite comfortable, and had plenty of room.  The location was perfect.  The canal is nice and quiet (no tour boats going up and down), and there is a tram stop right at the end of the street that gets you anywhere.  It was an awesome way to experience Amsterdam, & Derk stopped by as we were leaving to say goodbye. We highly recommend staying here!!!!"
515749,13061446.0,5/19/2014,10947838,Jan,"Loved the houseboat, fantastic location, could walk easily to all the places we wanted to visit. Derk was friendly and helpful. We had a great night watching him play violin with the orchestra at Concertgebouw in the City. Don't miss this opportunity if you get the chance. Thought Amsterdam is a great city, so much to see, a picturesque, clean, friendly and interesting city"
515749,13182927.0,5/21/2014,13832318,Oleg,"Loved Amsterdam! Impressions about new city start and end with place to stay. We are happy we have chosen Derk's houseboat for our stay. It was inviting and cozy. Our family of 3 - parents and 18 year old son - felt very comfortable. Derk met us at the boat when we arrived, showed how everything works (surprisingly, no different than in a house or an apartment). The location is outstanding - 10 min walk to museums in one direction, and to Rembrandt Square and Red Light District in opposite direction. Derk showed us places of interest and explained how to get there. All-in-all, wonderful experience! Thanks again Derk!"

It's nicely kept in the old style without missing any luxury from today's world (fully equiped kitchen, nice bathroom etc). The location is great as it's just between the historic center and the more ""young"" part of the city in the south. Plus: the tram stop and a street with nice restaurants is only a few minutes walk away!<br/>Derk is also a great and very uncomplicated host. Timings for key handover was perfectly flexible.<br/><br/>Really recommendable!"

The boat is perfect in every way. It met all of our living needs just like any apartment we have stayed. The location is fantastic - a quiet area yet so much within 10 minutes walking, including Rijksmuseum. Communication with Derk was always easy and efficient. And it was great meeting you, Derk. Thank you so much for providing such a fantastic accommodation experience! We hope our family and friends get the opportunity to share this experience too!"

Our only complaint was that we were not made aware of the early morning check out time upon arrival and came home the night before to a note on the door asking us to be out by a certain time. As long as you get all the information and communication from him, you should be fine.<br/><br/>"

It was pretty rainy when I was staying and I heard a lot of noise from rain tapping the roof. It was still fine for me to sleep but for somebody who can't sleep with noise, it might be good idea to bring the earplug. Anyway it was very special experience to stay here. Highly recommended!!!"

515749,19922818.0,9/21/2014,3354454,Bill,"A converted barge, house boat, canal home, whatever you want to call it - it's on just about everybody's wish list.  Derk's is a great one.  The neighborhood is perfect.  For one thing, it's a straight shot tram ride from the train station to his corner.  For another, it's within walking distance of so much of what you want to see - and if you aren't big on lots of walking, do what we did - take the tram out and walk back (trams are EASY).  The houseboat itself fit all our needs - we had breakfast and suppers in, and lunch out.  That saved us a lot of money plus we got to shop at the nearby market.  The place is clean and neat and Derk is a great host.  He even called the taxi for us on our last morning because I was worried that I couldn't pronounce the names of the streets correctly (it was 6:30 on a Sunday morning and the trams weren't running yet on our street - other days were fine, just not Sunday).   But remember, it's a boat.  We invented a new Dutch word ""Conkin noggin"".  "

Only slight problem we faced was a space issue when opening up multiple suitcases in the same room, but we got used to it soon enough. The room also has a mini-refrigerator - which was of great convenience. The neighborhood this apartment is located in is also very nice. Overall, very comfortable stay!"

We couldn't have been happier staying on this amazing houseboat for New Years 2013/14. <br/>The boat is really easy to find and easy to get to using public transport. Booking and arranging to meet Daan when we arrived was really simple. The houseboat itself is perfectly located to sightsee, with the Metro just round the corner, tram stations nearby and the canal boat/taxi just a few metres away. The centre is well within walking distance too.<br/>The boat itself was so comfortable, with everything we needed. The living space is spacious and the boat has all the amenities you could need (including a lovely bath to soak your tired feet!). The views from the houseboat are beautiful, and you can spend the day waving to people on the other boats going past from the terrace! We were warm and comfortable throughout our whole stay. <br/>We just wish that we had booked to stay a little longer! I would much rather stay somewhere as unique as this than in a conventional hotel.<br/>Daan was so welcoming, friendly and very helpful... we felt like nothing would have been too much trouble for him. We will DEFINITELY be booking to stay here again - hopefully very soon!"
785432,9703469.0,1/6/2014,9516699,Janick,"The Houseboat is beautiful. <br/>And Daan is really courteous. <br/>When you need something, he helps anytime. <br/>We had a great time on the houseboat. <br/><br/>we would go again anytime"

Both our hosts - Hannah and Derk - have been really helpful and we felt quickly ""at home"" on the boat which is very cosy and has all the facilities needed.<br/>We will come back - that's for sure!"
515749,21026115.0,10/10/2014,15202685,Claire,"On our recent stay October 6-10, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay on Derk's houseboat.  The location was convenient to central Amsterdam and the houseboat itself was clean and comfortable.  We were greeted on the boat by Derk who was welcoming and who made us feel quite at home immediately.  He helped orient us to sights that we wanted to visit.  We highly recommend Derk's hospitality and his houseboat to future guests."
515749,21124157.0,10/12/2014,18287126,Heather,"Can't say enough positive things about staying on Derk's houseboat, but I will try. It was charming, warm, inviting, unique, comfortable and simply amazing. And wait until you tell your friends--people think you are quite frankly the coolest person ever! (Not that that matters!) :)<br/>Stayed her with my daughter and we both agreed we wanted to move right in. It was that delightful. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. And I think it would be incredibly romantic, if you are with your significant other. Derk was great with communication and super helpful. <br/>The only negative was we only stayed for two nights. I'd happily stay there for a month! "

515749,21697224.0,10/22/2014,12748102,Toni,"A very nice experience in a lovely neighborhood. It was better than a hotel for our needs. We stayed with a 5-year old and she loved it. She could move around and find things to do. It was also easy to reach the trams and very quiet in the night. Thanks! If we come back, we will come back here."

515749,22289254.0,11/3/2014,1790788,Denis,"Derk's boathouse is amazing. It's a great experience to stay there and visit the city. The location is unbeatable. Close to Heineken Experience, Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum and the Vondelpark. A good grocery market and places to eat are also nearby. The place was clean, warm and cozy and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. Derk is a real superhost: attentive and responsive."

Super comfy bed and all the amenities you need for a pleasurable stay. Thanks Derk"
515749,26258991.0,2/8/2015,10406054,Angela,"Lovely to stay in a houseboat in Amsterdam.  It felt authentic without unnecessary frills and with necessary comforts. If anyone is worried about staying in the depths of winter, don't be - it's centrally heated and very warm.   Derk was busy making music but Shelley from the boat next door/dock gave us a warm welcome.  We are 2 adult friends with an 8 yr old and there was plenty of space.  Only positives to say really!  "

515749,26934582.0,2/22/2015,4689087,Fred,"Het weekend op de boot van Derk begon met een bosje tulpen en de sleutels van de buurvrouw.<br/>En dat was het begin van een heerlijk weekendje Amsterdam. Een weekend waarin Derk's woonboot zeker aan bijgedragen heeft.<br/>Een mooie ruime boot met een goed bed en prima sanitair.<br/>En op loopafstand van Carré en het Rijksmuseum. En ook niet onbelangrijk, de plaatselijke horeca.<br/>Kortom, een aanrader."
515749,27399103.0,3/3/2015,27170645,Anna,"Though Derk was busy when we arrived, we had a warm welcome from his houseboat neighbour.  The houseboat was in the most beautiful location, close to the Van Gogh Museum and in sight of the Rijks Museum.  The boat was wonderfully warm and cosy with lots of character and I would thoroughly recommend it as a base for the beautiful city of Amsterdam."
515749,27936356.0,3/15/2015,15913463,Nin,"Derk was a great host and really accommodating. He met me ahead of time to provide me with the keys so I can check in according to my convenience. Not to mention how lovely the boat is; and it could not be in a better location.  I was there with company but I hope to go back alone; it would make a great place for some self-reflection.<br/><br/>Derk, the only thing I didn't know what to do was where to take out the trash/garbage, as I could not find the local dumpster.  Sorry that you had to take out the trash I left behind.  Maybe that is useful information for the next guest.<br/><br/>Thank you again!"
515749,28176172.0,3/19/2015,3501415,Daniel,The absolute perfect place in a perfect area with a perfect host. The most Amsterdamy  way to stay in Amsterdam is this houseboat in a very scenic and quiet neighborhood (with the best views of the main canals) and super walking distance to the museum district and Europe's oldest zoo and markets and some very nice restaurants - and the foam museum.
515749,28387419.0,3/23/2015,26540988,Robert,"Derk was there to welcome us onboard and offer some helpful advice. The boat is in a great neighbourhood - peaceful, decent transport links and not far from good bars and restaurants. Comfy bed, decent shower and a handy kitchen area. Only slight negative was that the interior was a little cluttered, but not a problem. "
515749,28781938.0,3/30/2015,26167623,Neil,"The boat was ideally located in the museum district, 10 mins walk from all attractions.  Tram transport was at the end of the street, making access to the centre very easy.  It was incredibly quiet for a city centre, the noisy neighbour was a crested Grebe, but only occasionally.<br/>Although we didn't get to meet Derk, his communications were excellent.<br/>Thoroughly enjoyed the stay and definitely recommend anyone to try something a little different from a standard hotel room.<br/><br/>27th - 30th March 2015"
515749,28987792.0,4/2/2015,22626669,Meghan,"Derk was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to questions, gave us good directions, and was waiting for us when we arrived at the boat, very friendly and welcoming. The boat is cute and in good shape, traditional wooden ambience with portholes overlooking the canal. It is set on a convenient yet also quiet corner where two canals come together so it was very picturesque. The double bed is very comfortable, and the couch in the living room includes a twin-sized bed so it was the perfect size for the three of us. Derk provided everything we needed and also left a bottle of wine in the fridge. Shower was strong and hot. We could park our rented bikes right beside the boat. Derk also was flexible about check-out time. In all, a first-rate experience!"
515749,29257001.0,4/6/2015,21579583,Chris & Emma,"The houseboat is brilliant! We loved our stay here - 3 nights was not long enough! The city of Amsterdam is amazing, alternative and very fascinating. Staying on a houseboat in Amsterdam was just surreal! We felt very special. The houseboat is in a really good location, close to the city. It has everything you need. I could think of no better place to stay when in Amsterdam!"

Daniel est vraiment très aimable, prend soin que vous ayez tout a votre disposition (par exemple nous avons eu la chance d'avoir des vélos de prêts pour les 5 jours sur place ce qui nous a beaucoup simplifié les trajets). La chambre en soi est très mignone, avec, encore une fois, tout ce dont vous pourriez avoir besoin à votre disposition. L'endroit est calme, plaisant, et extrêmement bien tenu! Je recommande à tous ceux qui souhaitent visiter Amsterdam en paix (ou y faire la fête) ce super logement!"
2818,11310196.0,3/29/2014,6029464,Alejandro,"Daniel is a a very organized and professional host. A lot of information is at the hands of the guest from the very start. Tons of leaflets, magazines and print-outs about things to do in Amsterdam (plus bus routes and timetables) can be found in the room and in the hall of the apartment. The house is extremely clean. There are bus and tram stops nearby, which make it easy to get around the city. I would not hesitate to recommend Daniel to other people that want to stay in Amsterdam."

I loved staying here. If you go to amsterdam, I highly recommend staying with Daniel. He provided maps and information and thought of everything possible to make my stay in pleasant.

2818,14452516.0,6/19/2014,14891811,Veruzka,"He was a very nice host.  Myself and my fiancee stayed for 3 days in Amsterdam and we had a great time staying with Daniel.  He gave us help of where to go in the city, he rented bikes to us, and he gave us a map that was extremely useful in getting around.  He is very well organized and the whole stay was great and very easy."
2818,14614776.0,6/23/2014,13154289,Joseph,"We had a amazing stay at Daniel's.  The living space, room, and bathroom facilities are kept immaculate.  The neighborhood is very peaceful, quiet, and extremely well-connected to central Amsterdam, though several eateries and cafes are within a 5-minute walk.   There is also a well-maintained park (Flevopark) at the end of the street servicing nature-lovers and runners.  Last but not least, Daniel is both available, accommodating, and kind.  Do not think twice about this place!!!"

His apartment is very quiet and impeccably clean; the bedroom is very nice, exaclty as in the photos (pillows and duvet are very good). Besides, there is a table and a small fridge. The shower (separate from the WC)  is also very good. The apartment is not in the center but you can easily reach it by bus, tram or metro. There are various restaurants, bars and cafés in the area - this is great because you get to know places where tourists usually do not go. <br/>Daniel is a great host, he provided us with very useful info about transport and things to do in Ams. Our stay was great, we did not have any problem at all in the apartment. I am sure Daniel would provide any further assistance that we may have needed, he really thinks about every tiny thing a tourist may need during his/her stay in Amsterdam. I also wanted to thank him for finding the contact lenses we forgot in the bedroom! Definitely recommend! "

He was very kind and helpful.<br/>The room was very clean and quite. And there was a garden out of window in the room. In the every morning, when we woke up, we could see the bird’s tweet with the breeze softly. How can the morning be better?<br/>In the night, the curtains block the light completely during sleeping.<br/>Only alarm could interrupt our sleeping.<br/><br/>The bathroom was also VERY clean. The toiletries were all good stuff.<br/>It was filled with the AROMA. Also, It was good to take a shower with good temperature and water pressure.<br/><br/>First of all, His house is always neat and clean. And he knew everything for the trip in Amsterdam. Also, we had a pleasant conversation with him.<br/>Thank you, Daniel."

The boat was very comfortable and cozy. There were six of us staying on the boat and we had a very good time. Our only concern was the sharing of toilet, but with a bit of planning we worked it out. The hot water never ended and the boat was very warm. We also had plenty of extra comforters, sheets and towels more than enough for the 6 of us... We wouldn't hesitate to stay there at our next visit. <br/><br/>Thank you for everything Daan!"

785432,11258833.0,3/27/2014,10852220,Volker,"I stayed 3 nights on Daan's houseboat together with my wife and two friends of us. Daan is a very friendly and likeable person and gave us useful hints for our stay. Contact to him was very easy as he responded always promptly. The boat was clean and warm, even with night temperatures around zero degree. However, the boat was somewhat older than we expected. Not perfect was from our point of view, that the door to one of the bed rooms did not close, the other bed room was relatively small for two people and also noisy because of the sewage pump underneath. Nevertheless, Daan's accomodation has this special houseboat 'flair' and the advantage of being located almost in the center of beautiful Amsterdam."

He made it so easy to explore Amsterdam using public transport. He was always available and happy to answer question. He was friendly and talkative and interested in our days. He was very well organised and the apartment was as pictured and spotlessly clean. The bed were very comfortable. I bought some food without realising that guests don't have access to the kitchen (it is written in the room description), Daniel was very generous and still let me use his kitchen to cook my food. We had a little bit of trouble connecting to the internet in the bedroom (was strong in the lounge room) Daniel gave us a signal booster for the bedroom when we let him know. I would recommend staying with Daniel."
2818,20302184.0,9/27/2014,10676984,James,"After we arrived Daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. We proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. Daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people I have stayed with through Airbnb. In his apartment are countless books about Amsterdam that one can leaf through. However, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. He provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. It was a warm and informative welcome. <br/><br/>The accommodations were spectacular. There are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. The room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. Each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. We were never cold. The bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. The orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. <br/><br/>The location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. If one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. It is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. The apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-Dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that Amsterdam harbors. The area is quiet but active. Staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of Amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. There is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. Flevo Park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which Amsterdam is rooted.  <br/><br/>To the host himself: Daniel is helpful. He makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. He takes care of without meddling over you. You could talk to him not only about Amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. We had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. If you wish to visit Amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay."

He welcomed us when we arrived, showed us everything and instantly made us feel welcome and at home. The houseboat is in a great location with all the amenities you need to feel like you're in a home from home. We shall be visiting again some day I'm sure and my first port f call for accommodation will be Daan's houseboat! Thank you Daan! "

785432,11469142.0,4/4/2014,12231490,Frédéric,Great stay at Daan's boat ! Daan is very kind and always helpful. Great location close from everything. I would recommand the boat to anyone who is looking for a stay at Amsterdam 
785432,11511052.0,4/6/2014,12505301,Jon,"All five of us had a wonderful time, it was our first experience staying on a house boat but it certainly won't be our last.  Most of us have been to Amsterdam many times before but this added an extra dimension to the whole experience that I would recommend to anyone. Daan was extremely helpful and easygoing, very much felt welcome.  We all hope to see him again soon!"
785432,11735967.0,4/14/2014,9158016,Dimora Novecento Roma,"We have never seen Daan. A girl was there for the check in. Daan called me the night before leaving for having back the keys. We asked him to come to the boat at 10 am in the morning and not to be late because we had to leave. We waited him for half an hour and he didn't come so we left the keys inside. And he has never written us something like sorry!!! The boat is old. Many things are old and need to be refreshed. Towels are old some with holes!  One door of the shower is broken and also one window so you cannot open it. Beds are really uncomfortable. The door of one bedroom cannot be closed so there is no privacy. The door of the bathroom has no key! The girl sleeping in the main room has been waken up very early in the morning because of the light. Not all the windows have curtains. There are many things left in the bathroom and in the kitchen from other guests.. Not really nice in my opinion. In the bathroom there is only a very tiny mirror.. Impossible for girls! But the position of the boat was great! Metro very near, tram also. "
785432,11921188.0,4/19/2014,12821742,Kristof,Samen met de kinderen hebben wij genoten van een nachtje op Daan's boot! Een aanrader...

785432,12265729.0,4/28/2014,8317247,Michael,"We had a great time, with plenty of space. Dan could not have been more helpful. He had a problem with the pump the first evening which meant that we could not use the bath or WC the first night. However, considering it was a bank holiday, Dan worked all evening to fix the problem. We were very comfortable and couldn’t have wished for a better position to see King’s Day. One minor gripe was that the bedroom door proved impossible to shut. However, all in all we would recommend this a special place to stay in Amsterdam."
785432,12390224.0,5/1/2014,9884212,Julie,Très bon séjour sur la péniche de Daan. Péniche très bien placée dans le centre d'Amsterdam. Parfait pour découvrir la ville.
515749,30543984.0,4/24/2015,26182647,Theodore,The best stay we have had in Amsterdam.  We have visited for the last decade and I wish we had discovered this option years ago.  The boat was all that is advertised and more.  The neighborhood was pure Amsterdam and the host was perfect.  Don't know what else can be said.
515749,30755940.0,4/27/2015,6283272,John,"Thanks Derk for welcoming us to your boat! It was an amazing experience! It is well furnished and cosy, it is like to feel at home...but on a boat :-) and do that on the canal belt of amsterdam was so great!"
515749,30933726.0,4/29/2015,28888070,Brian,"Derk welcomed us even though we arranged an early arrival but were late.  As it was a holiday, we were restricted to access of beer, but he had 1 & gave it to us.  The location was easily accessible to public transport & walking.  If we were needing accomodation in Amsterdam again, we would to see if it available again."
515749,31031192.0,5/1/2015,10349004,Anne,"Accueil très sympathique et chaleureux de Derk sur sa très agréable péniche. Sourire, café, thé et bouteille de vin pour l'arrivée, c'est très agréable. La péniche est génialement située sur un canal très calme proche de tout ce qui est à faire à Amsterdam : Tout est accessible à pied! <br/>Par ailleurs, supermarché à 300m, restaurants, stand de hareng... Bref, génialement situé. <br/>La péniche est très agréablement aménagée. Une chambre, une salle de douche et un salon/salle à manger/cuisine. Et bien sûr, le pont pour se reposer au soleil... Une façon très agréable de séjourner à Amsterdam.<br/>Nous avons passé un superbe séjour.<br/>Encore merci Derk."
515749,31424382.0,5/5/2015,26479691,Yvonne,We have just return from 5 days in Amsterdam Such a beautiful city and so much to see.  Staying on the house boat was a new experience for us and Derk was there to welcome us and show us around the boat.  So quirky and different we really enjoyed staying there.  The area is really quiet and peaceful but within walking distance there are bars and restaurants and the tram is so easy to use.  Would recommend Derks boat as a base for exploring Amsterdam
515749,31652125.0,5/8/2015,11933817,Emma,"We had a fantastic stay on Derk's houseboat.  Derk was very helpful and gave us great suggestions for parking outside the city and using public transit to get into to city centre.  The arrival process was smooth and the boat is fantastic.  It is clean, spacious and in a nice, quiet location.  Would absolutely recommend :)"
515749,32493667.0,5/19/2015,26314472,Desiree,"Lieber Derk, vielen Dank für dein fantastisches Hausboot. Es war eine SUPER Entscheidung von uns, es zu mieten. Es ist so schnuckelig, ruhig, komfortabel, gemütlich, entspannend und man ist trotzdem nicht weit weg vom ""Feeling von Amsterdam"". Wir wären am liebsten noch länger geblieben.....wir waren 9 Tage auf dem Hausboot. Derk ist ein sehr lieber Vermieter, locker und unkompliziert und gibt dir tolle Tipps so macht es Spaß, ""AMSTERDAM"" zu entdecken...vielen Dank und bis zum nächsten mal, Desi & Thom"
2818,20503978.0,9/30/2014,19381082,Anna,"Daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. His appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. Hence we really enjoyed staying with him. <br/><br/><br/>After booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.<br/><br/>When we arrived in Amsterdam, we got a phone call from Daniel making sure we found his place okay. He is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in English. <br/><br/>Upon arriving in Niasstraat, Anna and I realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. To our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. <br/><br/>We were greeted by Daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. We were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with African wooden figures, listening to the Pachelbel canon. <br/>He gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. <br/><br/>You could tell from every detail that Daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. His WiFi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. We were positively surprised! <br/>For security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.<br/><br/>After that he gave us the tour of his appartement. It’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.<br/>There are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. They were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. Another smart detail. <br/>The room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. Daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. <br/>WiFi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two Android smartphones). Enough for (Hidden by Airbnb) , but not enough for watching YouTube clips. A WiFi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. <br/><br/>After this he showed us the bathroom. I was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. The bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. The toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.<br/><br/><br/>We can highly recommend @Daniel's and if we'll be visting Amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.<br/><br/><br/>Hartstikke bedankt Daniel!"

Derk is a friendly & helpful host and we look forward to staying again during our 2016 visit.  Highly recommend!<br/>"
515749,33221907.0,5/26/2015,8912126,Karola And Hartmut,"Lieber Derk, das Hausboot war eine super coole Variante um Amsterdam einmal anders zu erleben. Wir haben uns sofort wie zuhause gefühlt und danke deiner flexiblen und freundlichen Art fühlten wir uns auch willkommen und umsorgt. Uns war nicht mehr bewusst, dass das Hausboot auch wifi hat und daher waren wir gleich noch positiver überrascht. Danke dafür. Wir können Derk und sein Hausboot wirklich nur wärmstens empfehlen. Wenn wir wieder nach Amsterdam kommen sollten, werden wir versuchen das Hausboot wieder zu buchen. Die Lage ist einfach super und trotzdem extrem ruhig. 100% TOP!!!!"

515749,33979302.0,6/3/2015,26317525,Heather,"We loved staying on the houseboat. Derk was an excellent host. He was waiting for us to arrive, explained how things worked on the boat and gave us a guide as to where find supermarket, shops, restaurants locally. Tourist information on the boat was helpful.  Cold beer in the fridge was good touch! The location of the boat is excellent, in a quiet street but within a short walk from the hustle and bustle of the city. The boat had everything that we needed for our stay. Bed and sofa were comfy and the choice of cd's was particularly good. Going to see Derk play with the Orchestra was awesome. The coot family nesting beside us provided a lot of entertainment."

515749,35287866.0,6/17/2015,899737,Dobromir,"Our experience with the boat and Derk was perfect from the start. He was a very kind host who showed us how everything on the boat worked, and boy is it nice! All the amenities you'd expect plus the benefit of sipping wine while watching ducks paddle in the canal. Unbeatable. <br/><br/>Everything we wanted to see was within walking or a quick tram-ride distance."
515749,36014213.0,6/24/2015,12551751,Kevin,"My girlfriend and I stayed on Derk's boat for 3 nights, and we wish we could have stayed for more. It is a wonderful and unique experience that both of us will never forget. The boat itself was very spacious and well-kept. Derk was very friendly and offered to help at anytime if a problem arose (which none did). We would recommend this boat to anyone who is looking for something a bit different than the usual hotel experience. Hopeful one day we can return to Amsterdam, and if we do we know exactly where to stay.  "
515749,36188983.0,6/26/2015,32683308,Joelle Und Vlad,"Alles war wunderbar, wir wollten nach zwei Nächten auf dem Hausboot gar nicht mehr weg. Die Kommunikation mit Derk lief super einfach ab. Er ist ein total lockerer und netter Gastgeber, der auch super Deutsch spricht . :) Die Größe des Boots hat uns wirklich überascht, zu zweit hatten wir viel Platz und alles was das Herz begehrt war auch vorhanden (gut bestückte Küche, Gasherd, Regenduche, Liegeauflage zum aufs Deck legen etc.). Die Nachbarn waren, wenn man mit Ihnen in Kontakt gekommen ist sehr nett und es war total interessant sich das Leben links und rechts der Gracht anzugucken. Da das Boot in einem Nebenzweig der großen Grachten liegt, war man dem Boots- und Starßenverkehr so gut wie gar nicht ausgesetzt und das obwohl man dort super zentral wohnt und man sogar das Reichsmuseum vom Boot aus sehen kann. Wir können das Boot und Derk als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen!"
515749,36507296.0,6/29/2015,26716696,Anette,"Due to being stuck in transit I never personally got to meet Derk, my partner who arrived to Holland on the agreed time did however  and he said that all arrangements with picking up keys etcetera worked out beautifully and that Derk was very friendly and approachable.<br/>The houseboat lived up to the expectations well and truly, and the bonus after a three day journey across the world was how quiet the surrounding area was. My 13 year old lanky son said the sofa in the living room was super comfortable, and would nap there during the day. We had breakfast and lunch on to of the deck (front of boat) and contentedly watched the world go by. <br/>Nil complaints, only good feedback from us!<br/>Thanks."
515749,36772280.0,7/1/2015,15649746,Tricia,This houseboat was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. My favorite part is the deck of the attached boat... it was so nice to have a view of Amsterdam of my own for a couple of days with peace and quiet! The boat is in a great location to explore both the tourist areas and the real neighborhoods of the city. Derk was extremely kind and helpful and he allowed us to leave our bags in a part of the boat that would not affect the next guests when we came to retrieve them. 
515749,37945379.0,7/12/2015,7380708,Emily,"Wonderful, quiet street in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood! The boat was warm, clean, friendly, inviting. Really sweet neighbors, too. "

The weather was crazy - gale force eight. We loved all the interior quirks, especially the collection of model boats. Sitting out on deck with a view of the Rijksmuseum is very special."

Amsterdam von dort aus zu erkunden, hat uns seht gut gefallen."
515749,41056589.0,8/4/2015,5814101,Steven,"What a fantastic experience!  Even though Derk was unable to meet us in person, he made sure that his neighbor, Shelley, met us on arrival, showed us around ""our"" canal boat, and answered all of our questions.  Derk's boat was perfect for my wife and I and our college graduate daughter for our four night stay in Amsterdam.  It was fun and comfortable, and all of our basic needs were covered: kitchen for coffee and breakfasts, beds for the three of us, a good shower w/ plenty of hot water, and a couple of places to write or sit and read, including the sunny deck at the front of the boat.  And the location was perfect: one block from the main tram line along a safe and friendly street, and a short walk to the main Van Gogh and Rijks Museums, Vondel Park, and lots of unique neighborhoods and restaurants.  We rented bikes for three days and from our canal boat ""home"" we could bike to anywhere in the central city in 10 or 15 minutes.  Especially considering that we were in Amsterdam during Pride, with huge and fun crowds, stages, music, parades, and lots of partying, we were very fortunate to have our wonderful accommodations on Derk's canal boat.  We'll be back! "

He is a violinist and had got us tickets for the premier of an opera on the Saturday night which unfortunately we weren't able to take up as we were taking part in a painting competition and wouldn't make the early start.<br/>The boat has everything you need and is in a quiet area of right near the Rijksmuseum with easy links to the tram network. It was great to be away from the manic crowds. <br/>A very comfy bed , we didn't eat in as there were lots of local small restaurants very close by. <br/>Next time i will probably take my husband."

To be eye level with all the activities on the canal was fun. Kids enjoyed feeding the ducks and swans that came around. The location very near the central station which made it very convenient.  I would stay there again.

For us it was a different way of living on the water and a great feeling sitting on the roof-deck. Unfortunately we had to wait for the sun a log time... Communication, check-in and -out were very uncomplicated and we had a warm welcome. Everything was fine on the boat; thank you!"

He was also very responsive when it came to any issues (had some issues with the wifi the first day and he took care of it right away). If you're looking for a great place to stay away from all the tourist rabble, I highly suggest Daniel's place. "

Got everything we need. <br/><br/>This was a just short trip to catch up with my friend from overseas and both of us didn't spend too much time to plan the trip beforehand. But with Daniel's advice we did manage to have some great time in Amsterdam. "
2818,24206321.0,12/22/2014,13546702,Florian,Daniel was a wonderful host and the room was just as described/pictured.  He was able to provide good recommendations for what to do and had available things that travels need but tend to forget.  We rented bikes (for a small additional daily fee) -- that were in great condition and included everything we needed to be able to lock them up and ride safely at night -- and we found them to be a great way to get to know Amsterdam quickly and efficiently.  The neighborhood is very nice and it's easy to get to the heart of Amsterdam by bus or bike.  Highly recommended.
2818,24688179.0,1/1/2015,7992090,Alma,"I had a really wonderful stay at Daniel's. Daniel went above and beyond what I would expect from a host. The place is impeccable, comfortable and a really great to stay for a few days in Amsterdam! I absolutely recommend staying with him."

Their is so much to do in Amsterdam and we would not hesitate to do that same thing over again.  Very roomy and he answered all of the questions we had for him,  Thank you  Daan<br/>"
785432,14850094.0,6/28/2014,7475490,Dawn,Loved the boathouse!  Ideal location and on the river enjoyed being apart of life in Amsterdam.  Daan was very helpful and would go again
785432,15137835.0,7/3/2014,14829297,Margaret,"The houseboat is in the absolute best address in Amsterdam. We sat on the terrace and enjoyed a drink while waving to the tourists going by in canal cruise boats.<br/>The kitchen is very well equipped, & we thought it a great help to have some extra condiments in the fridge and cupboard.<br/>We thought there was a washing machine there, but it turned out to be a dishwasher in the small bedroom, along with a dryer!<br/>Bathroom has been partially renovated, only the small shower bay still needs work.<br/>Daan was super friendly when he stopped by after work, and Faye was great meeting us with the key etc.<br/>Will definitely recommend this houseboat for a real Amsterdam experience.

785432,15615074.0,7/13/2014,11542424,Jackie,"We stayed at the houseboat for 2 nights. It was a fantastic, unique experience for all of us. We travelled with 7 people, kids and adults and we all enjoyed it so much. The location is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anybody wanting to experience Amsterdam. I will definitely return again to the houseboat. Thank you Daan for being such an amazing host :)  "
515749,46578644.0,9/12/2015,8748937,Geoff,"We enjoyed one of our best ever city breaks staying on this quirky houseboat.  The canal is little used, quiet and charming.<br/><br/>Derk met us and made us feel welcome, we took him up on his offer of Opera tickets for Rosenkavilier.  There are plenty of grocery stores, bars and restaurants within easy walking distant, and the tram line is just around the corner, but out of earshot!"
515749,49063642.0,9/30/2015,31925561,Carlos,"Derk made all the arrangements and communicated with me frequently.<br/>He was expecting us and all went according to plan.<br/>wonderful and magical house boat.<br/>we had a wonderful time and will certainly return.<br/>We found the house clean and ready with wine and beer."
2818,25046545.0,1/5/2015,24755577,Laia,"Esta ha sido nuestra primera experiencia con Airbnb y la verdad, no hemos podido hacer mejor elección. Daniel es un encanto de persona hemos estado muy cómodas, cuida el mínimo detalle para hacerte sentir 100% como en casa. Aparte de ser una persona encantadora es muy servicial y en todo momento nos facilitó todo tipo de información necesaria para nuestro viaje sea del tipo que sea. Es muy atento y le puedes pedir cualquier cosa, la verdad es que cuida mucho a sus huéspedes y hace que te lleves un gran recuerdo de su casa y de la ciudad, que, por cierto, ánimo a todo el mundo a visitarla.<br/>Por otro lado, comentar también que las fotos de la habitación son tal cual,es decir, no te llevas ningún tipo de desengaño tema foto vs realidad.<br/>Desde aquí aprovecho para mandarle un saludo a Daniel.<br/>Muchísimas gracias por todo.<br/>Laia"
515749,49759987.0,10/6/2015,8528459,Rebecca,"Boat is located in a great part of Amsterdam on a quiet street. Walking to key attractions is easy and boat has all equipment to make a pleasant stay. Fun way to experience the city and great value for a homely and comfortable boat fit out. We enjoyed it enough to extend our stay. <br/>With no curtains on the port holes, those who had privacy concerns maybe a bit wary but we never had a problem. We would stay there again."
515749,50429318.0,10/12/2015,33738579,Martin,"Ein natürlicher, authentischer Ort mitten in Amsterdam. Eine Oase der Ruhe inmitten der pulsierenden Stadt. <br/>Ausgestattet mit allem was man braucht, auch in der kalten Jahreszeit angenehm warm. Ein bequemes Bett mit einer warmen und weichen Bettdecke. Eine Dusche mit viel warmem Wasser. Ein bequemes Sofa, eine Stereoanlage mit reichlich Auswahl an Musik. Die Küche mit allem was man für ein reichhaltiges Frühstück oder ein einfaches Abendessen sucht.<br/>Eine Unterkunft mit Charme und einem Hauch Magie, interessanten Lichtspielen und absoluter Wohlfühlatmosphäre. Ein Ort an dem man gerne ist und bleibt.<br/>Genauso authentisch wie das Boot ist Derk, der Gastgeber. Ein echter Typ, herzlich und offen. <br/>Danke Derk das wir hier sein durften."
515749,51424389.0,10/20/2015,32232390,Gordon,"Living on a house boat was a exciting and unique experience, something I had never done before and something I really liked. The house boat was big enough to be comfortable and had a good internet connection. The kitchen was good enough to make small meals if you don't want to eat out all the time. <br/> It was located in a pretty central location, within 7 to 10 minutes walk to everything including museums. Its near 2 minutes walk to public transit the tram, to central station the number 16 or 24. I took the wrong tram when I first arrived and was late.<br/>  Derk was a great guy very nice and accommodating, as I mentioned I was late got lost and he waited hours for me and gave some advice on what to see in Amsterdam.<br/> A really nice place and worth staying at in Amsterdam a different experience other than an apartment, its Amsterdam its got canals, do something different."
515749,144308304.0,4/15/2017,1973185,Joshua,"Perfect houseboat and location. Derk is a classic Dutchman. Creative, easy going, straightforward and a great host. The boat is a classic 1920's canal hauler that has been retrofitted for living quarters. The space is charmingly rustic. A classic era boathouse. Bed area is small but quitecomfortable (just not much headroom), pretty typical of these boathouses. The living/dining area has everything you need.  Best of all it is perfectly located. Its in a quiet corner of the canals but within walking and biking distance to everything. Vondelpark, Centraal, the canals etc. I almost didn't post the review becuase I want to keep it all to myself!"

Echt een aanrader!"
785432,15829695.0,7/16/2014,16199932,Kok Phan,Daan was helpful and awesome! we stayed at the boat house and that's definitely a special experience. The house was quite big and cozy with air conditioner

785432,16015873.0,7/20/2014,15697797,Shannon,"Excellent location in the centre of it all.  It doesn't get quiet until 7am, at least on a Friday night, but if the windows are closed it is fine and the noise didn't bother us.  It was extremely hot for Amsterdam the day we were there but the A/C worked a treat.  There is a little tv and Wi-Fi and the kitchen is stocked with all the necessities.  <br/><br/>My only complaint is that I chose this houseboat because we could drop our bags early before the 2pm check-in, which was important to me as we had a lot of luggage and only 1 day in the city.  I had confirmed this a few times via email. Then on arrival we had to wait around for a few hours for Faye to meet us with the keys. She was friendly and helpful via email and in person aside from this misunderstanding.     "
2818,25881134.0,1/28/2015,25399998,Taylor,"Daniel's home was beautiful!  It is just as pictured!  His home was very clean and neat!  As soon as we arrived, Daniel showed us around his home and we had a cup of tea.  He told us everything we needed to know and let us ask him any questions we had!! His home is very organized and was color-coordinated as far as towels and bathroom items!  He had bikes for us to rent (13 euro first day, 7 euro each day after) and they were great!! We got to see the city as the locals do and biking was so much fun!! It's difficult to get used to if you don't bike everyday, but it was so much fun! And Daniel told us everything we needed to know about biking in he city! Daniel's home is a 10 minute bike ride into the city which is perfect for any tourist wanting to see the city and an average Dutch neighborhood!  Our stay was short, 3 nights, but Daniel made us feel at home and we loved our cozy beds to crawl into at night! I would definitely stay here again! Daniel and his home were perfect! "

The location is great too with the city centre only a short bus trip or cycle ride away !"
2818,27163384.0,2/27/2015,3321930,Jörg,Daniels Unterkunft ist ein perfekter Ort um in Amsterdam zu übernachten. Die Anbindung mit Bus und Bahn ist perfekt. Man kann auch zu Fuß die Innenstadt gut erreichen und auf dem Weg gibt es einiges zu entdecken. Die Betten sind gemütlich und die Wohnung geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Daniel hatte gute Tipps für uns und ist ein sehr angenehmer Zeitgenosse. Mein persönlicher Tipp ist das Thai Restaurant in der Javastraat um die Ecke. Nächstes mal in Amsterdam bin ich gerne wieder Gast dort. Thank's for the time at your place. See you next time. Peace.

2818,28540642.0,3/25/2015,28712303,Sheldon,My stay at Daniel was good. He did a great job of staying in contact with through all my traveling delays. Daniel's place is a about a 12 minute bus ride away from Central Amsterdam. The place is very clean and quiet. The only thing missing would be television in the room. If you are looking to enjoy and explore Amsterdam this is a good place.

I cannot recommend Daniel enough, he was so accommodating, he went out of his way to get the answers to our questions, it was very convenient that he had his own bikes for us to rent. He messaged me all the time to make sure I was ok and would also give a prompt reply if I asked him a question. The place was very clean and looks exactly the same as the pictures.  I highly recommend daniel and would defiantly stay here on my next trip to amsterdam.   Thank you for a pleasant stay daniel."

I stayed there with my girlfriend and there was plenty of excess room for a larger group of people. The boat was clean, organised and comfortable. Can't fault it. We had a great stay, I would recommend to anyone travelling to Amsterdam."

We did not get to meet Daan but were met by the gracious housekeeper who even helped in storing our luggage post checkout. The Houseboat is overall clean and well maintained with a working TV , Music system , DVD player , Books, CDS and DVDS already there for you to try out. Having said this the boat does need some repairs : AC stops functioning after 2 hours due to a defect and the shower cubicle door was broken atleast when we were there but really minor issues not to be given much thought...

We were met at the boat by Faye.  She was very friendly and helpful with any local tours/attractions.  She offered to look up anything she did not have an immediate answer for.  The boat itself is on a main canal and situated in front of the Opera house, making it easy to find.  It is a short walk to nearly every major attraction.  Each of us had our own sleeping area and the boat has everything you need.  It was clean and very comfortable.  We spent a lot of time enjoying a beer on the rooftop patio and felt like locals with many tour boats passing by and taking our photos.  The area can get loud but closing the windows blocks out a lot of that.  We loved our stay and would definitely stay at this houseboat again.  I turned 40 during my stay and after being out for the day we returned to find 40th birthday balloons in the living room.  What a nice gesture and very much appreciated!!!!  Thanks again and I hope to return.  "

The host was very nice and helpful and showed us around the boat and explained everything. It was very useful to be able to use the garage for our car. The boat itself is spacious with a nice terrace but would definitely benefit from some renovation to be up to standard, notably the bathroom (shower) and the windows and doors.<br/><br/>"
785432,18560774.0,8/28/2014,13212445,Robin,"This was the ultimate place for us to stay in Amsterdam. You can hear about the canals, you can walk amongst the canals, you can even ride and tour through the canals. But this is one of the rare-ish chances to have your home base on a canal. It's actually the Amstel river, but, the point is, the ever-so-slight sway of the boat is like no other reminder that you are living the essence if Amsterdam. Daan is a gracious and patient host, with a nearby parking option and 22 years of experience living in the city. He offered help with ANY experience that we had questions about. While we didn't ask him for help, we did experience the city in it's full psychedelic glory, and having a boat as a landing pad was beyond any accommodation to be had. I've been to 6 continents, and I recommend this city. More importantly, I recommend this boat as a home base while you enjoy this artistic, unique city. "
785432,19023623.0,9/5/2014,16109625,Nicholas,"Wow. Could not have asked for a better accommodation in the heart of the city!  You can't find a better location...on the Amstel, on the bend into the city, next to the stopera...amazing for coffee in the morning as you people watch. So relaxing. The boat itself had every amenity you might want. The bedrooms had good storage and space and the beds were comfortable. It was just a wonderful experience. I would love the opportunity to stay again. "

We enjoyed the boat so much and had our breakfast in the morning on the deck. Daan is very friendly person, explains all very well and has some golden tips about places to visit or eat. Staying on the boat is very special. I would really recommend it. It is not a 5 star hotel of course, but has everything you need and you can never experience the canals of Amsterdam from your 5 star hotel window as you can do it from the boat."

2818,33353330.0,5/27/2015,10515603,Eleanor,"We had a wonderful experience @ Daniel's. Daniel was the perfect host - friendly, attentive and always available. He provided us with a much appreciated glass of water on arrival after taking our bags, and gave us a debrief on accessing the city via public transport. He provided us with maps to use for the buses as well as for the bikes (if you have the chance to utilise the bikes available for hire, definitely do so! You won't regret it!). The public transport is very easy to use - roughly a 5 minute walk to the bus stop and a 12 minute bus ride into the city. We had no trouble getting anywhere. Daniel was sure to check in with us over the few days that we stayed to see if we were okay and if we needed anything. The room was well serviced. He looked after us so well. Thank you Daniel!"
2818,33581423.0,5/30/2015,30524482,Karlheinz,Nice and quite room located in a gentrified area of Amsterdam apart from the touristic hot spots. I really enjoyed my stay not at least due to the charming host.
2818,33984656.0,6/3/2015,28738000,Elena,"L'appartamento è molto pulito. Daniel è molto accogliente, attento ad ogni esigenza dei suoi ospiti. Ci ha dato cartine e indicazioni utili al nostro soggiono. Molto comodo il noleggio delle biciclette direttamente da lui: il centro è raggiungibile in 10,15 minuti. Daniel è sempre reperibile al telefono per qualsiasi informazione e, quando è in casa, sempre disponibile per due chiacchiere e una birra...<br/>The room is very cosy, with everything you need, and the area of the flat is  quiet and within easy reach from the city center. Renting the bikes from Daniel is great because  you can start using them as soon as you arrive. Daniel is discreet but welcoming, and you can rely on him if you need any updated information regarding what's going on in Amsterdam. Great stay, indeed. <br/>"

Good information in advance made it a breeze to find the location. We had warmly welcome with a can of beer and Daniel provided us with lots of useful information (ideas, maps, tipps, how to use public transport, P&R, ...) about Amsterdam and made it easy for us to get a good start for our city trip.  He also was always at hand, when we needed some help. The rooms are very clean, you got everything you need for a good stay, and you even can borrow two bikes from Daniel. Like this, we could experience the city like we were living there - by bike. If we were going there once again, we know where to stay ;)"
2818,35099940.0,6/15/2015,6164576,Ben,Daniel is a great host. The apt is clean and in a nice neighborhood. I was able to run in a very nice park a couple of blocks away. You cannot walk down to the tourist part of town from his area but there is a bus close by that will get you there. I recommend Daniels Airbnb.

He met us at the boat on our first night even though we arrived at 10.30pm and gave us all the info on the boat and some info on the city. The boat was fantastic - clean, warm, full of all the necessities. The best part for us was sitting on the deck in the sunshine and relaxing. We were able to park our bikes outside the boat which was great. We'll definitely be back!"

He even gave us some tips on the area. <br/>Although it was not the cleanest accommodation, we had a very good time on the boat. In the evening you can sit outside on the deck and enjoy some beer. The boat has its own charm and definitely a cool alternative to a hotel.  <br/>The area is super nice and central. A lot of nice bars and restaurants are nearby, and you can nearly walk everywhere (Vondelpark, Museumsplein, Flower Market) <br/>We definitely would come back.  <br/>"

Derk was phenomenally helpful in suggesting areas of interest and places to eat and drink, as well as maintaining great communication throughout our stay. Of all the places we have stayed over the years, this will certainly remain one of the highlights."

Daniel also made sure to check up on how I am doing throughout my trip - when we had issues communicating by text, he continued to keep in touch via email, which is much appreciated. <br/><br/>The accommodations are as advertised. The room is cosy and looks out on Daniel's carefully cultivated garden. The lavatory and bathroom, which are separate, are exceptionally clean. The flat itself has close access to the public transit system should you opt not to ride a bike in Amsterdam. All in all, Daniel's flat is the perfect place to rest after a long day of sightseeing in Amsterdam. Highly recommended."

785432,23939687.0,12/15/2014,21345999,Wolfgang,"Daan is a flexible host and his house-boat is perfectly situated in the Center of Amsterdam. Being there you are eye-in-eye with the tourists on the canal-cruises passing by and you have a unique view over the turn of the river Amstel. If you want more privacy, you simply close the curtains. From there, any location in the old city-center can be reached by feet, so you're exactly where the action is. The boat is provided with anything you need and easily approached by train, tram and underground. The next big supermarket is 5 min walking. We had two great days there. Thanks very much, Daan. Wolfgang & family from Köln, Germany."

Absolutely every amenity you could need, felt at home as soon as we arrived.<br/><br/>The location is fantastic, 10 mins walk to the center of town.<br/><br/>Daan was an amazing host. Always there if you needed him, and so accommodating. Was very helpful in directing us to part of Amsterdam we hadn't seen before that were well kept secrets.<br/><br/>Overall an amazing stay. I cannot imagine doing Amsterdam any other way now. <br/><br/> "

I like the location, it adds to the experience of feeling local vs tourists. The city is an enjoyable walk and with Daniel's map easy tram and bus routes to an from everywhere.  His advice is spot on and as he listens to your interest books magically appear in your room.  The noise from the other residents is non existent.  The design and build obviously intended it this way.  Only noise on my stay were the birds outside my windows which if you weren't paying attention, you'd not even notice.  I plan on returning multiple times in the future to Daniel's.  "

I was well rested for each day's adventure. Daniel offered me some suggestions that were highlights of my time, including the Keukenhof gardens and the EYE Film Institute where I saw art films that would not be screened in my home town. I relied on his tour map (linking public transportation to main sights) more than my travel guide.  Daniel supplied me with electric water heater in my room so I could consume tea/coffee at my leisure, added some of my laundry to his own, showed me how to use (Hidden by Airbnb) map in real time and supplied me with a lanyard with his phone number (which I never used but was reassuring to have.

Not only was the room comfortable, colourful, light, quiet, and equipped with everything we could possibly need - and Daniel's flat spotless and beautifully furnished and in a great location - but Daniel himself is the perfect host, spending the first hour of our arrival talking to us about Amsterdam, answering our many questions, showing us how to get around. We felt immediately comfortable and welcomed, and confident that, during our three day visit, if we had any questions, Daniel would be there to help us. Indeed, on our first day, he emailed to check we were okay! We can't recommend Daniel highly enough!"

And he let us check out at 12.30 with no problem.<br/>The boat is located on a great location, very central, walkable to every main attraction. <br/>I have rented a lot of times a houseboat in Amsterdam, and it's the best way (for me) to experience Amsterdam.<br/>Unfortunately the boat of Daan was a big disappointment. I was embarrassed offering the boat to my wedding-guests. <br/>There is 1 good 2 persons bed, the other 2 persons beds are really small and are good for children but not for 2 adults.<br/>The door of the bathroom cabin was broken, the furniture looks poor and the overall look of the boot looks poor (it has been painted white, but I guess that was a lot of years ago). With the money that you pay for the boot of Daan there are much better boats available in the center of Amsterdam.<br/>I will not go back to that boat and I will not recommend this boat to any other people.<br/>"

We loved having a little outdoor space on the deck to watch the world go by. Location was fantastic, 4 minute walk down the beautiful canal to the tram and from there you are only a few minutes tram ride to all of the tourist attractions. Beside the boat there is everything you need, a lovely coffee shop, supermarket and restaurant. Derk was a fantastic host, he met us on arrival (even thought we arrived late) and chatted us through everything. He showed us on the map where we where located and talked through the different surrounding areas recommending good places to eat/drink. We had forgotten our travel adapter and Derk was straight there to give us one. Unfortunately our flight home was cancelled and Derk was more than accommodating, giving us a late checkout and even offering alternative accommodation if we couldn't get new flights. Thankfully we didn't need to avail of his hospitality as we rebooked a later flight home that same day but the offer was most welcome. <br/>In summary a great host, a beautiful place to stay and in a lovely location, we would highly recommend and will definitely be returning ourselves!"

The terrace was covered with dirt from the works in the neighborhood. <br/>Not fresh bed linings. It seems they were not changed from the previous guests or just were not washed properly.<br/>Dusty pillows. My wife got her eyes irritated. The pillows could definitely have some cleaning.<br/>The cleanliness of the kitchen. I come to Amsterdam often and I've been to many apartments. That was the first time when I didn't want to bring food home and cook. <br/>The floors were quite dirty. I'm not sure if the apartment had any cleaning recently. I wonder why there is a cleaning fee applied. <br/>A lot of stuff in every corner. Not much free space at all.<br/><br/>Neither Ann nor her sister were available for discussion and couldn't come to the apartment when we expressed our dissatisfaction.<br/>We stayed in the apartment for one night and have moved to another one, having made a last-minuted booking.<br/>We were ready to pay for one night we stayed and asked Ann to return the payment made for the rest two days. Unfortunately, Ann refused.<br/><br/>All in all, the apartment is ok if you like Vondelpark and do not care about the tidiness and cleanliness of the place. If you do - there are a lot of alternatives around. "

Its also near an airport bus route.<br/>The flat is a great space and is as pictured, we really felt at home during our stay there. This was made even more so with the little touches like the words ""You Look Great"" on there wall where a mirror would be. Thank you for letting us stay and hope your foot gets better soon."

It is location is perfect, near to everything you want to see. Though it is right in the center of town there is still a quiet felling. And you can pretend you are an Amsterdammer when the canal tour boats with photographing tourists are passing your windows facing Amstel :-) <br/>Daan was very kind, helpfull and hospital."
785432,29092497.0,4/4/2015,25454465,Lucia,Perfect location. Central and vey quiet. A bit basic but has everything you need. Very clean.<br/>Host was very welcoming and very helpful.

785432,29703777.0,4/11/2015,30490954,Joren,"Enkele uren vroeger aangekomen dan voorzien, maar we werden vriendelijk en aangenaam ontvangen. De boot heeft een zeer goede liggen en creëert een unieke sfeer. Genieten in Amsterdam, op het terras van een boot is geweldig! Ook was Daan zeer vriendelijk na een probleem met zijn privé-parking waardoor die niet toegankelijk was en we verplicht werden om onze auto tijdelijk op een duurdere stadsparking te plaatsen. Het bedrag werd gecompenseerd. Het interieur van de boot wordt op een accurate manier voorgesteld in de foto's, het is geen overdreven luxe, maar er is zeker niets te kort. De woonboot is met andere woorden zeker een aanrader!"

2818,88604811.0,7/25/2016,72231523,Martin,Wir wohnten 3 Tage bei Daniel und fühlten uns von Anfang an wohl in seinem schönen Apartment. Er konnte uns viele gute Tipps bzgl. Sehenswürdigkeiten und Essen geben und war immer offen für unsere Fragen. Auch konnten wir gute Stadträder bei ihm kostengünstig leihen und direkt die Stadt erkunden. Werden bei Gelegenheit gerne wieder kommen!
2818,89679184.0,7/29/2016,62490182,Leanne,"Daniel was the perfect host.  Very helpful with our stay in Amsterdam.  Good location, an easy, short bus ride to the centre of town.  The cleanliness of the apartment was exceptional!  Highly recommend a stay here."
2818,92495549.0,8/8/2016,66271151,Sahand,From the second you walk into Daniel's awesome abode your presented with a sense of cleanthiness beyond expectation! I was super lucky to have found Daniel as my first airbnb experience but it's a shame to be so spoiled with his hospitality you rarely find genuine chareaterstics as of Daniels! He goes above and beyond all expectations. And like I told him myself I look up to such secure cleanthiness and warmth of heart!!
2818,93329396.0,8/12/2016,29802439,Andrew,Daniel was quick in reply to my initial booking request and provided further information about Amsterdam upon approving my request. The apartment was clean and thankfully not up a flight of infamously steep Dutch stairs. Room was quiet and relatively close to transit. 
2818,94345094.0,8/15/2016,79524064,Leonardo,"Daniel es un excelente host, el apartamento es muy organizado y sobre todo muy limpio. De los mejor Airbnb que existen.

2818,98771062.0,9/1/2016,63636738,Cordelia,Daniel was extremely helpful during our stay and provided absolutely everything we needed for a great stay in Amsterdam. His information and maps he gave us were a huge help. 
2818,100206473.0,9/8/2016,73407547,Nicolás,Una gran opcion para dormir en amsterdam. Daniel fue un gran host. Muy preocupado por todo.<br/> Te entrega mucha informacion de la ciudad. La habitacion y el baño privado muy limpios y ordenados. <br/>  Es facil llegar al centro por transporte publico. Barrio muy tranquilo y seguro.<br/>Lo recomiendo 100%<br/>Saludos
2818,101164053.0,9/12/2016,49335486,Bala Murali,"Everything was exactly as described in Airbnb website. A cozy and clean room, comfortable bed and good safety measures. A very quiet place to sleep and recharge the phone. Excellent Wifi speed. We found everything in his house was neat and Daniel has the eye for perfection and attention to details. Very well kept garden at the back of the house, immaculate clean toilet and shower.<br/><br/>Daniel gives you plenty of privacy and also is helpful should you need anything. This is a perfect place for someone busy who needs to feel at home after a long day at conference. Very informative guide provided by Daniel, ideal for first time visitors to Amsterdam. Very good neighborhood.<br/><br/>We found it an easy walk to the bus stops and tram stops and not far from the bars and restaurant. It is ideal location for us to go to RAI and also central via Rembrandt Square and Dam Square.<br/><br/>We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you Daniel."
2818,102834828.0,9/19/2016,91002807,Yueyang,"这一次的Airbnb体验，我真的没法挑剔，于是给了Daniel全部五星。本来他是金牌房东，网上无一评价都超赞，我自己以前住过金牌房东的经历也很不错，于是我对他期待已经很高了，但最后Daniel和他的房间还是超出了我的预计！首先，房间非常干净。主客都是脱鞋进屋，而地板确实一尘不染，让人也不忍破坏这种洁净。其次，物品整齐有序，一应俱全，质量很好，比如床垫和枕头，比自家的还舒服；他连小音响都准备了，可以连接手机播放音乐。再有房间设计和装饰风格我很喜欢，整体面积虽不大，但经他的设计，显得宽敞舒适，别具心裁，装饰和椅子都是他从其他国家运回来的，家里到处是植物，生机勃勃。最后是他特别仔细贴心，他自制了地图和骑行指南，给我们解释时非常耐心，还准备了下午茶招待我们，是个很能聊的人，我最后很遗憾没能跟他交谈更多。他推荐的景点和餐厅也很棒。他房内还有很多惊喜，不剧透了，等你们去体验。I would say Daniel and his house is awesome and beyond my expectation (even though I actually had quite high an anticipation), considering its flawless cleanness, elaborate decoration (combine with European and African), well-equipped room and his comprehensive guide, friendly and supportive manner. Everything seems perfect and staying in his house really made our journey more memorable. Those detailed surprises shall be revealed by the next lucky ones. Overall, 100% recommended."

2818,108751543.0,10/17/2016,802614,Amit,"What an honor staying with one of the first hosts in Amsterdam. You can clearly see how much he cares about his guests with how meticulously clean the place is and how he has the place set up. He has thought about the whole guest experience end to end and it seems like he has perfected it over the years.<br/><br/>he was a wonderful host and the place was perfect! "

He communicated with us prior to and during our visit, providing tips on how to navigate the area and even events happening the weekend we were in Amsterdam. Immediately upon arrival, he provided us with maps and useful brochures. The apartment was extremely clean and the room looked exactly like the pictures. Daniel even let us leave our luggage at the apartment on the day of checkout since our plane was departing later in the evening. Would 100% reccomend staying in Daniel's home!!!"

785432,30065509.0,4/17/2015,15838611,Lori,"Great houseboat!  Daan was ana amazing host. The boat has everything you could ever want.  Plenty of fresh towels and all the comforts of home. Boat is docked on the Amstel River right across the Opera house with cute resturants and a nice big grocery store. Easy 20 minute stroll to the big waking shopping section. Can not wait to return. Thanks Daan for all your help Before and durning our stay. Our favorite part was having breakfast on the roof top deck. Lovely experience. <br/>"
785432,30274678.0,4/20/2015,1689503,Bastian,"Erst das negative: Der Zustand vom Boot sieht auf den Bildern besser aus, als es wirklich ist. Auch die Betten könnten besser sein. Wir waren zu sechst auf dem Boot und zwei der Bette sind lediglich 1,20m oder 1,40m groß. <br/><br/>Aber die Lage ist gigantisch. Die Dachterrasse ist großartig. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet und das Feeling im Hausboot zu wohnen ist einzigartig. <br/><br/>Sehr zu empfehlen! Auch war der Gastgeber Daan sehr sympathisch. "
785432,30545464.0,4/24/2015,9772164,Jill,"Daan was there to welcome us and offer help whenever we asked. The location and view from the houseboat was amazing! We could have sat watching the river all day except there are so many opportunities for fun and learning everywhere. <br/>The houseboat itself is old and has seen better days. It could definitely use some repair and brightening up. Many lights did not work and the heater was erratically turning itself on. The floor is old and splintery- do not go barefoot! For $200 a night we expected a more cheery environment. <br/>On the positive side, the hot water is plentiful and coffee is great!<br/>Overall our memories from 4 days on the houseboat are happy and will ways be cherished. <br/><br/><br/>"
785432,30752128.0,4/27/2015,18992561,Bertrand,"Our stay at Daan's place was amazing. It made us feel like real Amsterdam people, especially when we took our breakfast on the terrace on top of the boat ! And Daan was so nice : we got caught into traffic jams and arrived later than expected but it was no problem for him. He also checked on us during the stay :-)<br/>The only ""minus"" is the double beds are not very wide, it's barely worth noticing compare to the rest of what you can get there."

515921,2921553.0,11/19/2012,4095385,Evan,"We had a great time, very relaxing space close to all sorts of shops and the park. Very comfortable and relaxing to get away from the downtown scene."
515921,3174303.0,12/28/2012,1884773,Ram,"Anne was a very kind host. She waited for us to arrive from the airport and left us a map of the city and a bottle of wine! The place is rather conveniently located and overlooking a canal. Tram stops are not too far away and the airport bus stops at a walkable distance. The one thing that took me by surprise was that the apartment was on the topmost floor, and I've to say that it was a steep climb. But then I'vent been to Amsterdam before and had no idea about the constructions there.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood is fine, and being next to a canal, gives you a feeling of peace as you gaze outside. There is also a balcony, but couldn't use it in the rainy Dutch winter so we spent the time watching television when we were in the apartment. There was not much space inside to keep our things, so the baggage remained inside for most of the time. It would've been nice to have some drawer space or hangers, but was not really a problem for such a short trip. <br/><br/>In general, we enjoyed our stay and it was a great place to experience Amsterdam."

From offering us a drink (and nibbles!) upon arrival to sending travel tips for trains AFTER we'd left for the airport, and everything in between, he was the perfect host. I had some issues with the bike we rented from him (I'm very short!!!) and he had got his tools out and adjusted the bike for me before I had even woken up on day 2. Just brilliant. Also, the house was impeccably clean!! A lovely, friendly and very easy-to-talk to man. Thank you so much, Daniel :) "
2818,140174246.0,3/28/2017,68398465,Jeremiah,Daniel was an absolutely fantastic host. The first day he welcomed us in and provided information and suggestions on things to do around the city. I would highly recommend staying with Daniel for anyone traveling to Amsterdam.

We are a bit lost on the first day and Anne met us on the bike. I liked the apartment very cosy, creative interior, feels like home. There are some flaws but they do not spoil the experience. Balcony with fireplace is super. I think we will come back in the summer.<br/>Thank you Ann!<br/>Stan & Maj."
515921,3702791.0,3/5/2013,5105935,Vladimir,"Anne's place is cozy and very well arranged. The roof terrace is a big plus, especially if you're as lucky as to hit some sunny weather in Amsterdam. The neighbourhood is peaceful so we enjoyed a sound rest when we needed to, and the 2 and 16 trams took us wherever we wanted to go in 5-10 mins, so it's definitely a great location. The city map Anne gave us turned out to be the most useful thing in my pockets during my stay. Thanks, Anne!"
515921,4370166.0,4/30/2013,313167,Rabiah,"Anne's apartment is very well located, just outside of the center with plenty of nearby cafes. It's an easy direct commute from the train station (i.e. one tram from station to 4 blocks from her place). We even walked into the city one morning which you can do through the park.<br/>The apartment itself is cozy and comfortable with a sunny rooftop terrace, perfect in the morning or at the end of the day.<br/>Although we didn't meet Anne, communication was very easy and she checked in with us during our stay - had there been any issues, it was apparent she would make herself available. We had a wonderful weekend and were grateful for the apartment. Thanks, Anne!"

Nice little terrace otherviewing the canal as well. Close to 2 main lines of tram, direct to central station. not overpriced.  Nicely decorated, easy to reach. we will probably come back if the price remains the same."
785432,31038865.0,5/1/2015,26080824,Ilya,"Daad is a very gracious and accommodating host. The listing was accurate and everything on the boat was in the right order. <br/>We are very pleased with experience and recommend Daan's boat to anybody with the high level of confidence."
785432,31282163.0,5/4/2015,8569171,Alexandra,"Daan was a great host to us. He showed us everything, even a parking space (which is hard to find in Amsterdam city otherwise, believe me!). As he lives in his own boat only some metres away, he would be available for every issues you could have (we didn't have any, but it was good to know he was there, just in case ...).<br/><br/>This was my first time on a houseboat, and I haven't been to Amsterdam in many years (still I don't know, why - I won't let years go by until next time, because Amsterdam is just cool and great). I was amazed about how calm the boat was, even at night. And I had a lot of fun watching all those boats go by. People kept waving at us and taking pictures, we felt like VIPs on deck in the morning. <br/>Of course you can just shut the curtains if you want more privacy, so don't worry about this. <br/>The boat has everything you would need. Two beds (we only used one of them of course) and even an extra sofa-bed in the living-room. I would suggest the boat for 4 people though, maybe 4 people + kids is okay, but for 6 it could be a bit too small. The bathroom is rather big for a boat (I didn't expect that) and even has a bath tub - how cool is that? And to my surprise there was a dishwasher on board! We didn't use it, since we didn't cook (but we could have, the kitchen is fully equipped), but I liked how the whole space was so well organised and thought through.<br/><br/>The boat's location is fantastic, you couldn't wish any better! Right in front of the Opera, we had everything we needed within walking distance. Yes, you can even walk to Anne Frank-house (which obviously every tourist needs to see in Amsterdam, I have never seen a place so crowded in years). But we preferred going by boat - not the houseboat, of course, because that doesn't move, but there are so many boat tours in Amsterdam that you can easily spend days on one of them, going through all the canals, watching great old architecture and ... other houseboats :)<br/><br/>So if you are looking for a nice houseboat-experience in Amsterdam and you like your places better in a cool and easygoing manner than sophisticated designer-loft-style - Daans houseboat is your place. You will feel at home there, I'm sure. Thank you, Daan, for having us! We will definitely return."

Our three boys were very excited to stay on a boat, and it was a perfect base for walking to all the places we wanted to see. The accommodation was very clean, well equipped and exactly as it appears in the photos. Daan was away, but there was excellent communication & we were met very quickly as agreed to receive the keys.

He gave us a great tour of the boat and explained how it all works. It could've been cleaner but my husband thought it was fine. Great little rooftop terrace, wish we could've spent more time in Amsterdam and on the houseboat!"
785432,32879177.0,5/23/2015,26270840,Bik,Daan was an great host. He showed us all around the houseboat which was comfortable for the 6 of us. The roof terrace was amazing with a good view. The houseboat is just like in the pictures and is in a great quite location.
785432,33216817.0,5/26/2015,22703592,Jan,"wir waren zu 6 auf Daans Boot. 4 Frauen, 2 Männer. Das Boot ist super ausgestattet und ordentlich/sauber. Es mag für 6 Leute etwas eng sein, aber man will ja raus. Die Lage ist perfekt um das Zentrum (auch zu Fuss) zu erreichen & abends guter Ausgangspunkt für Party oder Barabende. (Dafür kann es nachts aber auch mal etwas lauter werden) Die Kommunikation mit Daan bzw. Jip war super. Beide sind entspannt und hilfsbereit. Alles in allem ein toller Aufenthalt -auch dank Daans Hausboot :) "
785432,33978733.0,6/3/2015,25948101,Kate,Daan was a great host - the boat is well kept and very clean. Perfect location to see all the amazing sights of Amsterdam. Loved staying on a canal and enjoying an authentic stay in a wonderful city.
785432,34186349.0,6/6/2015,21438687,Andrew,"Daan was a great host. He welcomed us from our flight and was very helpful with how to get to/from the airport. Once we arrived he gave us a thorough rundown of how everything worked on the houseboat.<br/><br/>The accommodation was well equipped with everything we needed for our 2 night stay.  The boat is very centrally located and within walking distance to the major highlights of Amsterdam and also great restaurants and bars.<br/><br/>Highly recommend staying here - we had a fabulous time and absolutely loved sitting on the deck with a drink in hand watching the boats stream up and down the canal."
785432,34285753.0,6/7/2015,19529890,Christabell,The woon boat is a great experience. You get to stay in Central Amsterdam amongst it all. Kitchen is well equipped and on a lovely day you can sit in the garden to have a beer. There is a supermarket close and an avondwinkel if you need any supplies.  Daan is very easy to catch up with as he lives on a boat near to give the keys.
785432,34762045.0,6/12/2015,23118020,Søren,"Daan is a very nice guy and a good host. He welcomed us, gave us good advice about what to see in the city, and he was easy to get in contact with, when we needed it.<br/><br/>The boat has a great location and we loved the rooftop terrace. It's really charming living on the river. The boat however is a bit worn down and in need of refurbishment. It's not a big problem, but it would make it easier to live there and more cozy. The bathroom is big and really nice with all the hot water you need. The living room could use a new sofa or a better sitting arrangement and the beds are a bit small.<br/><br/>All in all we recommend this boat due to location, charm and the great host. "
785432,34869676.0,6/13/2015,32577398,Scott,"Our stay on Daan's houseboat was the highlight of our trip to Amsterdam.  It was in a great location, within an easy walk to a lot of the major sights and literally right next to the square that hosts a daily flea market.  We relaxed and enjoyed watching the boats go by from the porch on the roof.  The houseboat itself has a lot of character inside and all the conveniences for a comfortable stay.  Daan was  a very accommodating host and his flexibility helped make our stay great.  I would definitely recommend this and hope to come back soon.  "
785432,35252089.0,6/16/2015,11194564,Nicole,Fantastic boat .. Fantastic location .. Would have liked to stay longer
785432,35367371.0,6/18/2015,28182171,David,"Although Daan wasn't there when we arrived,his friend Monica was who showed us around the boat and showed us where everything was and how things worked and gave us keys.Daan came and met us later on and introduced himself. To me he is a perfect host as he was very friendly and was willing to help you with whatever help you needed. Daan leaves you alone to enjoy your stay,but can be found a few boats along should you need to contact him. The neighborhood was excellent!A perfect spot to explore from as you can wonder off in all directions from here with shops,bars,restaurants and whatever else your after all within strolling distance. The boat was as described and had everything you could need for a short stay. You could sit all day on deck and just watch the world go by as  the area is very busy during the day but once the boats stop at night is very peaceful."
785432,35541859.0,6/20/2015,22810851,Audrey,"Beautiful boat house, perfectly located in the center of Amsterdam, at walking distance from everything and amazing views at the blue bridge. All that you could need to feel at home is there and the owners made it all easy for us. Very nice also to be able to rent a parking spot from them. All perfect, if we come back to the city we definitly would try to stay there again."
785432,35902360.0,6/23/2015,19990427,Sarah,"It was easy to connect with Daan and get into the houseboat.    We were both in a rush so there was not a lot of time to share information, however, everything was easy to use and Daan had written an information sheet that the info that we needed on it.    Also, when we connected with him during our time there, he responded quickly and helped us out.   The location is ideal and the boat  is lovely-  it was a perfect Amsterdam experience!"
785432,36079007.0,6/25/2015,517871,Matt,"Truly an amazing experience.  Very comfortable and unique experience for our family of four to stay on Daan's houseboat.  Great location, wonderful host and a unique Amsterdam experience.  Highly recommended and we hope to come back!"

785432,37283355.0,7/6/2015,1871227,Rachel,"We hebben een super leuk weekend gehad op de woonboot. Alles was top geregeld, genoeg handdoeken, beddengoed en alles was schoon. Er lagen zelfs wat boodschappen voor ons klaar. We werden hartelijk ontvangen en we kregen handige tips voor bijv het huren van fietsen en leuke dingen die we konden gaan doen. De boot ligt op een ideale plek, zeker een aanrader!"
785432,37634248.0,7/9/2015,25092991,Linda,Daan made us feel very welcome allowing us to drop our luggage off early at the boathouse and showed us where to park our car. The boathouse was as specified. It was comfortable and clean. The neighbourhood is clean and safe but could be noisy at night but that is to be expected in the city centre! 
515921,8235797.0,10/21/2013,9317227,Marisa,This was my first time to Amsterdam and I loved staying at Anne's apartment. Very cute and quaint and walkable to the major museums. 
515921,8554199.0,11/4/2013,5400828,Angela,Staying at Anne marie's was great. She has a nice apartment really close to public transportation and in a nice neighbourhood. The place was clean and had everything for a comfortable stay.

Only minutes away from beautiful vondelpark, local amenities and great transport links. Great communication, Anne-Marie made everything so easy. If only the weather was better so we could've enjoyed the terrace more!!<br/>Thank you Anne-Marie!"

515921,12658629.0,5/7/2014,1271742,Anna,"We have spent a week in Amsterdam in Anne-Marie's appartment. Unfortunately we haven't met the owner, but she left us all the instructions and some travel tips. <br/>Appart is a nice and cozy place, especially the terrace with great view and a small fireplace, where we spent lots of evenings. Room furnishing is simple but clean.<br/>tram#2 stop is around 2 minutes walk and you can get to the centre  in about 15 minutes or take a walk through the park (about 45 minutes by foot)<br/>All in all, everything was good, I would recomend this appartment as an option with terrace.<br/>Thanks Anne-Marie!"
515921,12893825.0,5/13/2014,14096168,Louise,"I didn't meet Anne-Marie but communication with her was great from enquiry to leaving the property. The neighbourhood was lovely just a couple of streets away from Vondelpark which was great for us as we run every morning. <br/><br/>Her directions were spot on and we managed to find bagels and beans to collect her keys without any problem. The apartment was perfect for the two of us, really cosy unfortunately we couldn't use the roof terrace as it rained pretty much our whole trip.<br/><br/>I would say the location is pretty much central with the ability to walk, cycle or catch a tram with minimum of fuss, it was a great introduction to Amsterdam and I would definitely book her place again."
515921,14737433.0,6/25/2014,9725881,Claire,"Anne-Marie's appartment is very nice, sunny, quiet, and very well situated in the city. We had no problem and spent a very good time."

2818,158529822.0,6/7/2017,64367573,Julio,"Daniel is an extremely pleasant person - an experienced traveller  himself. His room and service area (bathroom and toilets) are probably  the cleaner on thus planet- I really plan to indicate his name for the Nobel Prize, if the Sweddish Academy opens an airb&b competition... Serioysly now - we enjoyed his place a lot. The mattress of his bed is unbelievable - so confortable (I never trusted soft matresses- my back is very senstive). Riding a bike one can easily reach the central area within 20-30 min depending on your energy and wind factor. Thre is a nice park nearby (7 min). We had a fantastic spring wheather most if the time  (3/4 d) which obviously makes a difference. In two occasions we returned home at 1:15 am - it was safe and  fun.  If you are less lucky and must face cold  rain, the tram and bus are not too far, but you need a strong umbrella (Daniel will provide you if required). In summary - Enjoy his room because Amsterdam (with sun) is an urban paradise. Daniel is a privileged man..."
2818,160959292.0,6/16/2017,26702728,Yilong,房主Daniel本人非常注意卫生，所以房间很干净，设备也很齐全。<br/>另外，房主对于安全非常重视，在房子里设置了警铃，不过，阿姆斯特丹这么安全，根本不需要这些东西嘛，哈哈
2818,162082426.0,6/19/2017,127316896,Lakshmi,"Daniel's place is a little away from Centraal but is in a quiet and well connected locality. He's a very nice host and his place is absolutely and spotlessly clean (cleaner than hotels!). Like the previous travelers, we too, found the beds in the room to be supremely comfortable!<br/>He was extremely meticulous and thorough and the directions he gave us to arrive at his house and also go about the city were very detailed and extremely helpful. <br/>The house is close to both bus and tram stops and the locality also seemed safe late at night. There are also a couple of restaurants and local bars around. <br/>We had a lovely stay. "
2818,164430072.0,6/27/2017,20308278,(Email hidden by Airbnb),Un lugar agradable para sentirse como en casa. Daniel es muy atento y está pendiente de todo para que te encuentres a gusto. Aunque no esta en el centro está muy bien comunicado y el paseo desde la casa al centro es muy agradable. <br/>Es un barrio tranquilo. La casa es muy acogedora y nos sentimos muy cómodos.<br/>Si volvemos a Amsterdam desde luego iremos a casa de Daniel.

Upon arrival, he gave us a quick  tour of his place and it was incredibly clean and provided us with everything we needed and more. In fact, he left us with great guides on Amsterdam and info on how to get where we wanted. Location wise, his place is great, as everything we wanted to get to was within walking distance and close to the heart of Amsterdam.<br/><br/>As a host, I can't commend him enough. Any time we had a question, Daniel was more than willing to go out of his way to provide us with information about Amsterdam and was a tremendous help! I send infinite thanks to him for his outstanding hospitality and for letting us stay near the heart of Amsterdam for an absolutely great price!!"
2818,202402676.0,10/11/2017,170840,Dan,"I've stayed in many AirBnB places, from the best to the worst, and I'm a host myself. I can honestly say that I've NEVER met a host who went so far out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of. Daniel knows his city and is happy to share his knowledge -- not in an overbearing way, but with a thoughtful, light touch."

His place was lovely, even more so in person than in photos.  It was located in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood in eastern part of Amsterdam.  A short walk from a number of restaurants and café.  Easy access to public transportation which will take you into central part of city in 15 minutes.  Our 4 nights stay here were delightful and will stay again in a heartbeat!"

515921,17477362.0,8/12/2014,15956473,Thomas,"Our first time using airB&B so we weren't sure what to expect...Overall the apartment was fine for our stay with it being close to everything, cooking facilities,space and the host left plenty of information for us! The only negatives that we found were that it was a bit dirty (we had to wash the plates/cups/pots/pans before we used them) and there was a mouse problem...after we left bread sticks out completely sealed unopened, they were eaten through each night! Once that is sorted for the money we paid we believe its about on par with what to expect."
515921,18381014.0,8/25/2014,18168370,Nathan,It was exactly as advertised . Nice quiet residential area away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Has some good local shops right around the corner for about all you need. I would stay in her place again if ever on Amsterdam .

515921,27553175.0,3/7/2015,18813853,Jon,"Anne-Marie's flat is absolutely wonderful! The roof top terrace is cozy and private with a great view. The flat is very clean and stylish. Has everything u need. 2 blocks from the tram, 1 block to the supermarket. Just outside the city so it's nice n quiet but not too far if u want a crazy night in town. Patrick and Anne were very helpful hosts with tons of info on what to do and where to go. Prob one of my favorite places so far on air bnb. If u get the chance u must book this flat!! Or else hidden gems will slip between your fingers!! "
515921,27695766.0,3/9/2015,21245084,Nayna,"<br/>I and my friend stayed at Anne Marie's over the weekend and I have to say that the place looked quite nice in pictures except for the bathroom but when I read that she had renovated it, we decided to take a chance and go with it. To begin with Anne-Marie did give us specific instructions on how to get to the place which was good and we appreciated it. After getting there, the living room is as it looks in the pictures which is nice except there was dust on the lamps and the floor and didn't feel very clean so clearly a lack of effort on the part of the host there. The kitchen was fully equipped on the bright side. The bathroom though was unfortunately worse than we had thought... The bathroom didn't even have a door to it and as mentioned here the toilet is seperate where the flush doesn't work unless you press really hard into it. The tap was leaking all of the 2 days that we were there. The first day there was hot water but the next day it was freezing cold water such that there was no way we could've showered and we called Anne marie 4-5 times at an interval of 20-30 minutes between each call to ask about the hot water but she did not answer at all and then called back when we were already checked out and at he airport so clearly no marks for promptness there. Also the lock on the main door is faulty. One of the nights we literally had to tackle it for 10 minutes before it finally gave in and opened. She does mention that the apartment in on the fourth floor but I don't think it has been mentioned there's six flights of very steep stairs so Incase you have big suitcases I don't see how it's possible to take them up yourself. We did not meet Anne marie herself and picked up the keys from beans and bagels which despite all of my qualms is a very nice spot. Overall, for the price that we were charged which was about 85 GBP per night, it was a very dissatisfying experience and I would not recommend it or stay here again as I personally have stayed at much better b&bs before where the hosts actually put in an effort to make the guests feel comfortable and not just rip them off because quite frankly this is what it felt like. Amsterdam in itself is such a beautiful city with such an amazing vibe so I would recommend you look elsewhere instead of this place so as to not dampen the experience at all. This place and the unavailability of the host is just not worth the money I paid. "
515921,28574726.0,3/26/2015,28818888,Ana,"Anne-Marie is a very cool, flexible and pro-active host. <br/>The apartment pictures are accurate though some work still needs to be done in the bathrooms and the maintenance of the place. The bedroom views are to the canal which is very nice. The directions given to get to her place are clear and precise.<br/>The neighbourhood is very nice and friendly, is easy to find a restaurant, bakery, grocery or public transportation to and from anywhere you are in.

The Apartment is not as Big as the photos suggest, but Big enough for two People. The Stairs to get to the Apartment are indeed very steep. We did not Meet Anne-Marie and got the Key at a Bar close by without any Problem. The Apartment Could be in better condition and is a Little bit pricy for what it is.

785432,42108638.0,8/11/2015,28878448,Cedric,La péniche est idéalement placée par rapport au centre ville touristique. Petite terrasse super sympa pour profiter de la vue et du bon air. La péniche a tout l'équipement nécessaire. Le wifi est bien pratique. Bref que du bonheur.
785432,42504028.0,8/14/2015,9480269,Joe,"Lisa welcomed us on behalf of Daan and looked after us well. The boat was excellent for a family of four, very spacious and well equipped. The location is an excellent base from which to explore the city. We would thoroughly recommend for a super holiday."

785432,43243373.0,8/18/2015,16611004,Jenny & Mary Jane,We stayed only 1 night on the houseboat and wished we could have stayed longer. The position was perfect for exploring Amsterdam by foot and was easy and convenient to find. Daan was very friendly and helpful and the experience was great. I highly recommend the houseboat for a truly dutch experience.

785432,44276448.0,8/25/2015,15987990,Frances,Lovely and memorable boat-tastic weekend. Makes me want to live on a house boat permanently.  Thanks to Daan for his care and attention.
785432,45918620.0,9/7/2015,22037739,Gail,"This house boat was perfect for the four of us. It would be hard to find a better location in the heart of Amsterdam. Comfortable beds, room to sit, including a roof top area. Daan looked after our every need, including printing off our boarding passes for our next day departure. Thanks Daan for a wonderful boat experience."
785432,46855335.0,9/14/2015,22970991,Regula,"Daan hat uns herzlich willkommen geheißen und zeigte uns sein Hausboot. Nichts fehlte. Sogar die Kaffeemaschine stand Einsatz bereit. So haben wir uns ein Hausboot vorgestellt, sauber und praktisch, leicht schaukelnd, aber kaum spürbar. Der Geruch nach Schiff und etwas feucht. Einfach genau dieses Besondere haben wir gefunden und sehr geschätzt. Die Lage war sehr zentral und wir fanden jedesmal zurück. Eine gefährliche Autobahn für Velos direkt vor der Tür. Einfach like Amsterdam. Super."
785432,47043901.0,9/15/2015,35497129,Stephen,Daan kept in touch and was informative. The boat was just the fun we expected.
785432,47244889.0,9/17/2015,33101759,Lucie,"We had a fantastic time staying on Daan's boat. There were 6 of us and we felt there was enough space to eat and relax on board. The beds were very comfy. Very well equipped with cutlery, crockery etc and even had a dishwasher! The shower is brilliant, just like one at home-we were really impressed. <br/>Everything was very clean and just as described. Location is brilliant-very close to Waterloopein metro, flea market, cool cafés and supermarket. Perfect place to base for exploring the city. Daan was very helpful and friendly and let us keep our bags on board when we checked out which was great. Highly recommended for a different place to stay in Amsterdam! "
785432,47606614.0,9/21/2015,10379085,Marlene,"Alles hat super funktioniert! Daan hat uns empfangen und uns alles ausführlich erklärt. Das Apartment war funktionell ausgestattet, sauber und wir fühlten uns wohl. Die zentrale Lage des Bootes war perfekt für alle Unternehmungen, sodass keine anderen Verkehrsmittel benutzt werden mussten. Bei Fragen konnten wir uns immer an den Vermieter wenden, der ganz in der Nähe auf einem anderen Boot wohnte. Preis/Leistung einfach top!"

2818,246324313.0,3/25/2018,156777916,Qiang,荷兰的房价和物价普遍有点贵､尤其是接近市中心的。但是Daniel是个特别认真可爱的房东，与他同住你不会任何的拘束，并且地理位置很不错:到市中心和火车站都有直达的公交。而且房间布置和设施也都很贴心。期间不小心发烧也得到Daniel热情的帮助。非常感谢~
2818,247980405.0,3/30/2018,24554860,Sidney,To me Daniel is the definition of Superhost.  His place is very well organized and spotlessly clean. The room is comfortable and has thoughtful amenities. Daniel gave me useful information both on practical things and on places to go. I can certainly recommend!
2818,250821352.0,4/6/2018,106747691,Heather,"Daniel was a great host! He gave us great tips for transportation and local shops and restaurants, and his place was very clean."
2818,251262997.0,4/7/2018,65825127,Tessa,"I had to cancel my trip to Amsterdam so unfortunately, I didn't get to stay with Daniel. I got very sick the day before I was due to go and couldn't leave home. I still wanted to tell the world that Daniel has been so gracious and kind in negotiating refunds under these extenuating circumstances. Thank you so much! I hope to rebook and stay with him later this year!"
2818,253771242.0,4/15/2018,159519256,Seth,"Great spot just outside downtown. Quiet, local, clean. Plenty of local cafes nearby to get breakfast lunch or dinner. Daniel is amazing host who I would highly recommend!"

2818,257476898.0,4/26/2018,24554860,Sidney,"This was the second time that I was at Daniel's Airbnb. Just like the previous time everything was very well organized,  accurate, and spotlessly clean. It was again a very comfortable stay. Communication on check-in, practicalities, and such goes very easy.  And it is simply nice talking to Daniel. I hope to stay there again."

"
2818,272089484.0,6/3/2018,182747240,Garima,Daniel's apartment is very accessible via tram and is close to javaplein where you can get some good breakfast and snacking options. Apartment was very clean and room had a lot of small amenities making things easier.He also had a hair dryer :). Daniel is a very warm person and gave us a lot of info on our checkin.
2818,280889700.0,6/24/2018,15387714,Michael,Daniel goes above and beyond a typical host to make sure you have everything you need to enjoy your stay. Easy access to public transportation and some nice restaurants in walking distance made this a perfect place to stay during my recent trip. 
2818,282839010.0,6/28/2018,191740514,David,Daniel's apartment is very pleasant and comfortable. It is Located not far from the center. Daniel helped us alot and gave some tips to make our visit great. Thank you Daniel!

2818,294024437.0,7/21/2018,38247916,Daniel,"A neat room in a downstairs home, with shower and bathroom in the hallway. Daniel makes it feel like a hotel room, and you get your own key to enter the house."
2818,297053687.0,7/27/2018,33989203,Gabriel,"Daniel is a wonderful host. He is very responsive and easy to talk to. The accommodation​ is out of the city center, which is both good and bad. A 15-minute tram ride will get you to the city center no problem, though. Daniel also makes it very easy to understand how to get around as well. It is clear Daniel has thought everything through when it comes to accommodations, and if you like a quieter, more residential neighborhood, I would suggest staying here. "
2818,306887941.0,8/13/2018,207303078,Jonas,"Getting in touch and check-in/-out very uncomplicated. Quiet neighborhood, close to tram and bus stations. Room and bathroom very clean. Daniel makes you feel at home and provides a lot of information you might be interested in as tourist and even looks stuff up for you in the internet. Would totally recommend. "
785432,49090159.0,10/1/2015,23115799,Rudy,"We just spent a few wonderful days with our kids (10, 8 and 6) on the houseboat. It's the perfect location for seeing and feeling Amsterdam. We were very lucky with the weather and enjoyed the sunshine on our little private terrace when not strolling through the city and the museums. The really nice thing about the boat is, you are in the heart of the city, but having some kind of privacy at the same time. We will come back and looking forward to see Daan again, who is a very nice and easy going host. "
785432,49229375.0,10/2/2015,29452875,Isabelle,"Temps de réponse au départ un peu long mais ensuite très bonne communication avec Daan : heure d'arrivée, place de parking ( il se débrouille très bien en français ! ) .<br/>A notre arrivée nous avons rencontré Monika , personne très sympathique , souriante qui nous a accompagné pour trouver le parking privé et sécurisé proche de la péniche à un très bon prix  ( très rare à Amsterdam ! ) . Les photos sont conformes au lieu et nous avons passé un très agréable séjour ( trop court ! ) : l'emplacement est ""top"", au coeur de la ville , calme , et grâce au soleil nous avons pu profiter de la terrasse: ce fut vraiment une expérience originale. Il y a tout le confort à l'intérieur , on s'y sent bien. Daan nous a très gentillement autorisé à laisser la voiture dans le garage l'après midi ce qui nous a permis de profiter encore de cette magnifique ville ! Nous n'avons qu'une envie , c'est d'y retourner ! Merci à Daan et aussi à Monika ! "
785432,49882812.0,10/7/2015,38314361,Crystal,There are few word to describe how much we enjoyed our stay in the houseboat!!! Daan was very friendly and helpful. The location was great & living in a modern boat apartment on the river was pure magic.  We truly lamented to have such a short stay and will have to return.  We recommend this experience highly to anyone visiting Amsterdam.  Cheers! 
785432,50743757.0,10/14/2015,19063775,Sherri,"We didn't have the opportunity to meet Dan but I must say booking this houseboat was one of the best decisions on accommodations for our tour of Europe. The houseboat is a mix of modern and rustic. It was roomy enough for 5 of us. The kitchen and table was wonderful. The best part was sitting on the roof top patio watching the tour boats go by and drinking our wine. The kids loved it and thought staying on the boat was a real adventure. You cannot beat the location, just minutes to everything. We really loved it and would definitely go back!"
785432,50916547.0,10/16/2015,22640446,Emma,We had a lovely 2 day stay on the house boat even if it was not long enough to visit the beautiful Amsterdam. The house boat is clean and tidy and has everything you need. Movies for night time and great coffee for the mornings. Conveniently located to get to the sights of Amsterdam. We were very comfortable there with 2 couples and a baby. Daan was a great host and helped with any questions that we had :) We stay there again when we return to Amsterdam! 
785432,51046286.0,10/17/2015,38551071,Johannes,"Daan was a good host and it was easy to get the keys for the boat, even though I arrived late and a friend had to take the keys. The boat can host 6 people in total and is comfortable.<br/><br/>The situation of the boat is perfect! Directly at the River."
785432,51533324.0,10/21/2015,16571804,Lucas,The houseboat is just amazing! And Daan is a great host - trying to make the stay as convenient as possible. Thank you Daan :-)

515921,30928647.0,4/29/2015,10177927,Valerie,We spent a very nice week end! The appartment of Anne-Marie was really lightly and comfortable exactly like the pictures. And we had fun  on king's day!

515921,74822067.0,5/16/2016,48574840,Scarlett,"Das Apartment von Anne-Marie liegt in einer sehr netten Gegend. Wenn man mit dem Auto anreist, kann man perfekt die Park and Ride Parkplätze nutzen. Innerhalb einer Stunde war man zu Fuß in der City, ein schöner Spaziergang durch den Park. Die Dachterasse ist bei schönem Wetter bestimmt ein großer Genuss! Man kann Überall etwas zu essen einkaufen und die Bahn ist sehr nah. Ich habe Anne-Marie persönlich nicht kennenngelernt, aber die Schlüsselübergabe verlief reibungslos! Insgesamt war es ein schöner Aufenthalt in Amsterdam!"

515921,82399568.0,6/27/2016,43685027,Marie,"JE NE LE RECOMMANDE PAS !<br/><br/>Les photos de grandes qualités sur le site, ne reflètent pas la réalité.  La chose la plus désagréable est le bordel général!! Se trouver dans la salle de bain avec la panière de linge sale, ou devant la porte d'entrée avec des chaussures en pagaille, ou encore ne pas pouvoir passer entre le lit et le mur à cause des affaires des propriétaires laissées là.... c'est vraiment inacceptable pour de la location - surtout à ce prix là! <br/><br/>Le désordre général et les restes de nourritures dans le four qui empestent l'appartement, font vraiment douter au niveau la propreté!! Et apparemment la télévision a disparu depuis la publication des photos.<br/><br/>A partir du moment où nous sommes entrés dans l'appartement nous n'avons eu aucune nouvelle de nôtre, même pas pour savoir comment rendre les clefs alors que nous avions envoyé plusieurs messages...<br/><br/>122 euros/nuit (avec tous les frais inclus) pour être logés dans un appartement comme celui là c'est vraiment beaucoup trop cher!!<br/><br/>Seul point positif : Accès au tram facile.<br/>"
515921,88656072.0,7/25/2016,9570961,Céline,"The apartment was really nice, close to tram and in a lovely neighborhood. Some surprises nevertheless : no TV (despite the pictures of a TV in the add), no hamac and a really smelly garbage in the bathroom. <br/>"

515921,141482535.0,4/3/2017,43347255,Tito,"Our experience in Amsterdam was incredible. Anne's apartment is in a super chic neighborhood, close to cafes and restaurants. We went several times at Bagels and Beans - the best breakfast in the area. We used TRAM, which runs on the main street and we were dropped off at the main points of Amsterdam - Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, Museumplein, City Center and Centraal Station. Everything so easy to use that we were delighted. Anne's apartment is gorgeous, super organized and clean. Anne was always so kind and helped us with anything we need. She has great tips from the city - the best was the westergasfabriek fair. I, as a gastronomer, went mad with everything I saw and tasted.<br/><br/>Amsterdam is a lovely city."
2818,314002828.0,8/26/2018,27415312,José,Daniel so nice and gave us many advices. We loved our stay in Daniel’s place. The location is in a very quiet area and very close from transportation.

He has so much information at your disposal, from tram lines and the stops you can get off to tons of information guides. I also had laundry I needed to get done and he was so helpful in getting it done. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2818,353508627.0,11/28/2018,216099941,Sam,Daniel could open a 5 star hotel. Our stay provided everything we needed to be comfortable and happy.

It’s in a quiet neighborhood outside of the bustling downtown, but a close 15 minutes by tram. Daniel went out of his way to be helpful with directions and things to do. He even sent me a note on our first day asking if we were having a good time. I highly recommend this AirBnB and would definitely stay here again."

2818,437040976.0,4/14/2019,24675898,Elizabeth,"Daniel’s accommodations are good, located outside of the city in a quiet neighborhood. Public transportation is 5 minutes from the apartment, and it runs every 15 minutes into the city (bus 22 or train 14). The bedroom has two twin beds, with a small fridge and a closet. There are quite a few Amsterdam books in the bedroom as well. <br/>Overall was a good stay and we recommend this location to others that want to enjoy what Amsterdam has to offer."

515921,145619103.0,4/19/2017,6697199,Amy,Fun place to stay on edge of the park. About 15 mins into center by bike. Bed is really comfortable and house is cozy and very lived-in. Easy access to cafe and bike rentals. Thank you for the great stay Anne-Marie!
515921,147687632.0,4/28/2017,21580169,Yasya,"Мы бы не рекомендовали квартиру в размещении, так как цена не соответствует качеству. Да, расположение квартиры отличное, рядом находится прекрасный парк, продуктовый магазин, остановки. Также порадовало присутствие постоянной горячей воды, а также отопление. Но квартира по фото не соответствует реальности, очень много изменено деталей. Хозяин не встречает, что доставляет неудобства, особенно, если вы впервые в городе, и вам приходится искать место, где хозяин оставил ключи. Также, нигде не указан номер квартиры или этажа (нам пришлось подставлять ключ в каждую квартиру, чтобы найти свое жилье). Квартира полна вещей хозяина, это можно заметить уже при поднятии по лестнице. Отсутствуют полки для размещения своих вещей (полностью все занято вещами хозяина), нам пришлось все дни вещи хранить в наших чемоданах . В ванной комнате были навалены в корзину грязные вещи хозяина. Полы в квартире белые, сложно было оценить их чистоту, но пыль присутствовала. В ванную комнату отсутствует дверь, очень холодно мыться. В спальной комнате в подоконнике огромная дыра через которую сквозит, а также слышен шум с улице. На окнах кухни, белые занавески желтого цвета местами, видимо их не стирали тысячу лет. Нам пришлось рыться в кладовке с кучей вещей хозяина, чтобы найти утюг, по разрешению хозяина, но гладильная доска отсутствовала в квартире или мы ее просто не нашли. Хозяин отклонил наш запрос на изменение даты выселения, хотя согласно правилам отмены, мы могли это сделать и написал нам в (Hidden by Airbnb) , что мы можем уехать, но деньги нам не вернут. При выезде нас не провожал, что доставило неприятности в дальнейшем, так как стал на нас клеветать, что мы совершили вещи, которые не совершали тоже через личную переписку в (Hidden by Airbnb) . Испортилось очень сильно настроение и весь отпуск мы находились в неприятном чувстве. Хозяин имеет очень сильный негатив в нашу сторону."
515921,150970362.0,5/10/2017,30846731,Ximena,The location was fairly close to the center; about 5 minutes in bus. There is a bus stop about 2 blocks from Anne's place. The location was very nice and quiet with plenty restaurants and shops nearby. Anne was very helpful throughout our stay and we would definitely stay here again! 
2818,438662977.0,4/17/2019,128648334,Ladislav,"Daniel is an amazing host, he gave us plenty of great tips about how to get around Amsterdam. His apartment is in amazing location, very easily accessible by tram or bus, 15min from the Centraal Station. <br/>To say that the apartment was super clean is an understatement, we have very high standards but would give extra stars for cleanliness if I could."

The location is awesome, right next to metro, tram and markets...easy to walk to all locations.  Daan's friend Monica helped us out and even let us leave our luggage before we checked in!  Would stay there again and again. "

785432,52308321.0,10/28/2015,27599977,Cheryl,"We just spent a fabulous two nights on Daans boat. The location is very central (maybe a 15 minute walk from the central train station) but there is very little noise disturbance. We enjoyed strolling around the city and sightseeing and the boat is in the perfect location, within a short walking distance of most tourist spots.The views along the canal from the boat are beautiful.. One of the prettiest sunsets I've seen! It's lovely to sit on the rooftop terrace in the evening with a glass of wine and watch people and boats going by. The boat is well equipped with everything you need and the bed was so comfy (just what you need after a tiring day exploring the sights of Amsterdam)  It's a lovely experience to stay on a boat rather than a hotel or apartment. <br/>We were greeted by Monika on our arrival and met Daan twice  during our stay, both were really welcoming and helpful. Daan even let us leave our bags on his nearby boat on our last day as we weren't leaving until late evening. <br/>This was one of the nicest short breaks I've ever had and Daans boat comes highly recommended. :)"
785432,52673322.0,11/1/2015,25409253,Trevor,"Daan was a great host - friendly & welcoming, Daan explained everything we needed to know about the boat and about Amsterdam.<br/><br/>The location was quite simply superb. The boat is moored right in front of the National Opera House and is pretty quiet at night when you need to get to sleep. All the shops, restaurants and bars you need are just a stones throw away over the bridge. There are some good supermarkets nearby which Daan explained how to get to & the best ones.<br/><br/>We all loved Amsterdam - not been here before but will definitely come again, it is a lovely, friendly city. Easily navigable by bike from the bike hire place down the road. For us it had everything we wanted in a city break."

All in all an amazing stay in Amsterdam."

It was perfect for the 2 of us but could easily fit more comfortably. We walked everywhere from this central location. From the museums, markets, restaurants and bars, we had an amazing trip. Thanks to Daan for offering up this houseboat to the Airbnb family. I highly recommend this option for your next Amsterdam trip. <br/>"

I really appreciated him staying up for my late arrival, and he didn't make me feel uncomfortable creeping in at night or using the room to work. The folding table / desk in the room came in very useful! There are some lovely places to grab breakfast, dinner or a drink  just around the corner too :)  Cafe Chantilly is a must try."
2818,486731147.0,7/13/2019,16155483,Brian,I've stayed with a lot of hosts and Daniel stands out as probably the best organized and one of the most helpful. He had many useful tips to offer and guidebooks to borrow and was immediately and thoroughly responsive to questions. The room is exactly as it appears in the ad. The location in Zeeburg is great -- it's a cool neighborhood away from the hassle of the city center while still being only a short tram ride away. Highly recommended!

His home is centrally located in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood. It was immaculate with lots of cute little touches to make you feel nice and comfortable.

The room is as described. Daniel was very helpful (but leaves you in peace if you want that too) and I would recommend his place if you are not looking for a place for yourself. Thanks!
2818,567000584.0,11/21/2019,47472820,Austin,"Daniel is a great host. There were small touches like a beautiful hand written calligraphic note and nice flowers in the room to make it feel more homey. He provided much information about the local area, which is a nice neighborhood with great food and cafe options and not too far from the heavy bustle of the touristy areas. The apartment space is shared with Daniel, but it was never a problem. The whole space is sparkling clean."
2818,605289892.0,2/14/2020,330320508,Sario,"Daniel's apartment was very cozy for our four night stay. The location was ideal for us to be in walking distance to a yoga studio we went to every morning, and access into the city was convinent by tram. <br/><br/>We appreciated Daniel's professionalism and genuine kindness in hosting us. He was kind enough to arrange purchasing museum tickets on our behalf online when we found out that we could not obtain them by cash, and he even helped us quite a bit with our laundry.<br/><br/>Our stay could not have been better and the only ptoblem was that we.didnt have more time to stay longer!"

La chambre est très confortable et très propre : très bonne literie, petit coin pour prendre le thé avec bouilloire et thé/tisanes à disposition, placard pour ranger vêtements et valises, petite chaîne hifi. La salle de bain et les toilettes sont également d'une grande propreté, les serviettes et les draps sont fournis. Daniel est plein de petites attentions (prêt de chaussons puis de gants pour notre tour à vélo par exemple), il est toujours disponible pour nous renseigner mais reste quand même très discret ce qui est très appréciable.<br/>La chambre n'est pas en plein centre mais les nombreux moyens de transport (plusieurs lignes de tram et de bus) la rendent très facilement/rapidement accessible. Nous avons également beaucoup marché ce qui nous a permis de découvrir la ville.<br/>Je vous recommande ce logement ! J'espère pouvoir y revenir rapidement, Amsterdam est une ville magnifique. Merci beaucoup Daniel."

The apartment is 4 minutes from tram or bus stop, nearby (like 6 minutes) are two supermarkets for basic grocerries. To the centre of the town its like one hour by foot, but 15 minutes by bike, 20 minutes by public transport. You can also rent bikes from Daniel during your stay. The room and apartment were clean and in the room there was everything you need (towels and hairdryer are a sure thing), but you have also access to kettle and some basic dishes, tea and coffee.

It was very clean, the heater worked perfectly, the shower always had hot water. We used the kitchen a couple of times to cook lunch and dinner, the cooking and dining utensils were complete, in fact more than what you'd need. Location was perfect! Everywhere you'd want to be is within walking distance, and it's a safe distance from the red light district if you're strolling around with your family. Daan was helpful, with directions especially when we first got there. Would definitely recommend it to anyone!"

Daan did give a very helpful introduction to the houseboat and was easily reachable for any queries / issues at any time of the day. <br/>The boat itself however was smaller than we had expected (we were a group of 4 adults and 2 kids). Luckily one adult didn't make it, so the rest of us were relatively more comfortable in the boat. <br/>"

Daan was very helpful and a great host. The pictures of the bedroom on our visit did not quite match with what was there. The second bedroom's bed was very small and short and was not suitable for 2 people but luckily there was a very big sofa bed so as there was just 4 of us, one of us went on the sofa.

Die Lage des Bootes ist wirklich großartig direkt an der 'Stopera'. Die Attraktionen des Zentrums von Amsterdam liegen direkt vor der Haustür und auch wenn man einfach nur auf Deck sitzt, gibt es immer etwas zu sehen. Das Hausboot ist sehr schön, praktisch und effizient eingerichtet mit allem, was man so braucht. Mit sechs Erwachsenen war die Schlafsituation allerdings etwas beengt - mit vier oder auch fünf ist es sicher perfekt!"
785432,65490217.0,3/15/2016,2404641,Amy,"This cute little houseboat is in a great location - very central with everything within walking distance. Daan was a helpful host and very friendly. Unfortunately, the boat didn't seem to be accurately represented by the photos and the boat is in older condition than what is shown. "
785432,66662162.0,3/24/2016,14413023,Katrin,"Daan´s houseboat was perfect regarding our needs. Communication with Daan  - a nice guy and very good host - was quick and easy before our arrival as well as during our stay. We used the private parking which turned out to be a good idea because our youngest son fell ill two days before our departure to Amsterdam. He decided to sleep on the couch, so his elder brother could spread in the (quite small) bed of the second bedroom. <br/>The central location made it possible to return easily to the boat from our city excursions and have a look at our sick boy who spent his time looking videos and chatting via W-LAN. We went out for dinner and were very happy to find nice restaurants within a one (Eetcafé Blauwbrug, Agabi Santa Maria) and five minute walk (Szmulewicz) in order to stay close to the boat/our son, the ""boat guardian"".  <br/>All in all, it was again a very positive experience to book an accommodation via airbnb. And staying on Daan´s houseboat was extraordinary and a great adventure for us ""landlubbers"". Thank you Daan for letting us stay :-) We try to come back!"
785432,68061417.0,4/2/2016,42426507,Stefanie,"We loved Daan's houseboat!  It was an ideal location, next to a tram stop and a main subway stop.  There were several restaurants and pubs nearby as well as a small grocery store that had all the essentials.  The boat itself comfortably slept the 5 of us, had a well-equipped kitchen and great view of the canal and all the goings on there.  Beautiful views of Amsterdam from the top of the boat at sunset! <br/>Daan was friendly and helpful, but also left us to our own adventuring.  Highly recommend for families - worked with with our two teenagers too."
785432,68673711.0,4/6/2016,33756308,Bettina,"Nice and very central location. <br/>The pictures must be a bit old, as the sofa and bed were not the same. <br/>Nice and very friendly and helpfull hosts. <br/>We really liked to stay here but were a bit disappointed about the interior; the boat smelled mouldy and the windows had black mold. One of the beds were very narrow - to narrow for to grownup friends, so one of us had to sleep on the brown big chair and other Brown furniture put together. "

785432,70011179.0,4/15/2016,11572523,Pornrawee (Mod),"a boat house Amsterdam is a unique experience to try, especially a boat house in such a central area of Amstel - you cant get more central than that! We were a party of 5, and we had a lovely stay though it was only for a night. The nice rooftop is such a good area to relax under the sun. "

785432,70950228.0,4/22/2016,10426518,Marianne,"La péniche est très propre et très bien située.  Tout est accessible à pieds mais le métro et le tram sont à 30 secondes à pieds le top!! Les propriétaires habitent à 2 péniches de là  et sont très disponibles. Le monsieur parle bien le français parfois c'est plus simple. De plus il est arrangeant concernant la dépose des bagages et il y a du café à volonté ! Les 2 chambres sont sobres, dans l'une d'elle il semble compliqué de dormir à 2 adultes plusieurs nuits, le lit est un peu petit.  C'est une location que je recommande sans hésiter. Bonne vacance!!!"
515921,193857734.0,9/15/2017,26552625,Morgan,Tout était parfait !! Nous avons reçu pleins d'informations utiles de la part de Anne-Marie.<br/><br/>L'appartement est idéal pour 2 voire 3 personnes. Il se situe au 4ème étage dans un quartier très calme. Comptez 15 minutes en tram pour être au centre d'Amsterdam. <br/><br/>Nous avons passé 4 jours super et je recommande vivement Anne-Marie si vous voyagez à Amsterdam !
515921,200656725.0,10/6/2017,13848448,Berthrand,"The location of the apartment was close to all amenities, we even found an organic market, close to public transport, and excellent to walk to vondelpark. <br/>The images need a bit of updating as well as the description of the place, however, it is faithful to size and style. In addition, it seemed to be slightly messy, but the super comfortable bed made up for it. Checkin in was a bit of a challenge, as our previously agreed upon meeting location changed at the very last minute, and it was hard to reach both Patrick and Anne Marie. Very minimal contact with both of them, which wasn't a problem for us.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good experience, as long as you're not fussy with the details."
515921,201442132.0,10/8/2017,39322976,Alex,Great flat for a weekend away in Amsterdam. Anne-Marie was a good host who had all our needs covered! The flat is by a tram stop which went straight to the town centre in 20minutes.

515921,323721969.0,9/16/2018,83026973,Kike,"The flat is greatly located. Center is 30’ walk, but you can stroll through a great park to go. Or ride with the bike. 10e a day at the corner! Then the flat is at the top floor and there is a nice roof terrace to enjoy nice views and relax. To achieve that vie, you have to climb three floors Lots of light. Nice area. Anne Marie was very helpful and nice and little Zoe is delightful!"

Vondelpark is just around the corner and the centre is in a walking distance and if you feel lazy there's also a tram stop next door. There's also a roof terrace which is really cool. Communication with Anne-Marie was smooth."

Transports near by. 30min by walk from some museums. The shower room is kinda small but you can see it on the pictures, and it’s very cold in the flat if you don’t correctly put the heater on (we couldn’t figure it out on the first day) but we had a great stay! I recommend it."

515921,434613814.0,4/8/2019,64655451,Despoina,The apartment that me and my friends saw has nothing to do with the one at the photos . It was so dirty and it smelled so awful you could not take a breath !! I have taken so many photos of the real apartment you may not believe in your eyes ! I wonder what kind of person want to deceive tourists and ruin the image of the city sometimes ! <br/>Of course the hostess after our complaints never showed up in messages or phone calls and everything found their right way with Airbnb . <br/>It is so sad that we should stay somewhere else the last minute!! Our suffering was due to the fact that hostess was not willing to clean the apartment as she claimed that it was clean and she shut down the phone telling me that we have just different aspect of cleanliness. <br/>I have a lot of photos showing the mess and the deceit .<br/>Apartment lack of soap as well . <br/>In conclusion hostess informed after 24 hours Airbnb that the apartment was ready ( Saturday evening ) but it was really late for us as we needed safe and clean roof over our head as well a clean place for our staff .
515921,440679868.0,4/21/2019,150710407,Adrián,"Located on a quiet place, but well connected with public transport. The house may seem quite little, but we were four guys and had no problem with that — moreover, we enjoyed the house as an extra experience in Amsterdam thanks to that awesome terrace. Also, Anne-Marie is really kind and nice with her guests."
515921,443643444.0,4/26/2019,83490185,Jan,"Super cozy and charming flat. So nice to have an  almost private rooftop balcony, and traveling to the city center is very easy. Anne-Marie did everything to make everything convenient and easy for us."

515921,638909387.0,7/17/2020,16248110,Jovana,"Anne`s place is very nice, small but full with life and a good taste. Their roof terrace is a great extra thing where you can enjoy if the wetter allows, and their daughter`s room is beautiful. We came with an infant, and she enjoyed in Zoe`s room so much. You will have all you need to cook in the kitchen and a dishwasher if you don`t want to clean the dishes yourself :) <br/>The apartment is by bike about 15 minutes away form the center, and has a really good  public transport connection. If you come by car and need the parking, we figured out that Park and Ride system which is a bit complicated, but if you do everything well, you will pay very small amount - for example, we paid 3 Euros for three days. The apartment should be cleaner but we tried to enjoy our stay as much as we could regardless of that."
515921,6.08527e+17,4/19/2022,177673218,Roslyn,"The good: clean, quiet, safe, nice rooftop access, enough space for 3 of us, directions for check-in and check-out were easy to follow, easy tram access to city center.<br/>The bad: We didn't have Wifi the whole time. Host claimed it was a provider issue but I don't think she knew her own Wifi password. Climbing 4 flights of stairs was bad enough but the last flight is being used as storage which is very difficult to navigate with luggage. No extra towels, no wash cloths, no hand towels, no paper towels, no door between shower and bedroom, shower head broken, failed to mention that the bed in the small room is a bunk bed and requires a small person to climb into it, toilet wouldn't flush without removing the tank lid, one of us woke up with new insect bites every morning, host claimed we broke a vase when we did no such thing. Wish we hadn't paid so much to stay here."

It is in a great location in a quiet neighborhood outside of the city, with bus and tram stops within 5min walking. The room and beds are very comfortable.

20168,28186.0,3/2/2010,70091,Justin,"The location of Sasha's B&B makes it ideal for short Amsterdam visits; everything you might want to see is walkable. <br/><br/>We stayed in the smallest room of the building, which was o.k. for the one night we spent. Our room was neat and clean, as was the bathroom. If you travel with more luggage and want to stay longer, make sure to book a bigger room. Unfortunately, on the site it's not quite clear how to choose the room you'll be staying in.<br/><br/>"

The Apt is exactly as shown in the photos, very clean, and central in the Jordaan area, right across from Westerkerk and Anne Frank Huis, and just around the corner from the best pie at Winkel's!!!  The Dam square and Red Light District were only a short 7 minute walk. <br/><br/>Aemilia was a great host, she met us for our late arrival, helped get our luggage up to the apt and had a handy list open on her Mac for us to use as a reference. <br/><br/>I highly reconmmend this apartment and Aemilia as a host. For any future visits to Amsterdam we would definitely stay here again!!!"
517996,3752259.0,3/11/2013,1680037,Aude,"Wonderful stay in Amsterdam (4 nights) ! Aemilia's place is very charming and comfortable, extremely well located. Aemilia was on holiday when we came, but everything was organised for our arrival and stay. She had also left us some good addresses around. If you want to feel like an Amsterdamer during a few days we stongly recommand this place ! Just be aware that the stairs to reach the apartment, like probably in most old buildings, are narrow and very steep. Keep it in mind if you have sore hips or heavy luggages !"

The apartment feels light and airy, though a typical Amsterdam size.  I was there during a particularly cold and windy week, when the windows were quite drafty, though the heater worked well.  I would recommend her place."

Everything is in walking distance and local nightlife is a very quick 2 minute walk across the bridge. The boat itself was nice & it had all the small amenities you could wish for. Tea & coffee were supplied and all appliances worked. There were 4 of us staying in the boat and that was the perfect number. At night we felt safe walking around the area. We didn't meet Daan but we did meet his friend Monica who was very welcoming, polite & helpful. When we return to Amsterdam we would definitely stay here again & recommend to others. "

It's central position was amazing everything we needed was within a 5 to 10 minute walk.

The canal is vivid, and watching the canal from the deck having lunch and/or drinking tea was the most memorable from our trip to Amsterdam. City Opera and Ballet is right next to the houseboat and we decided to see the opera one of the nights, happy not to spend any time for commutes. The organic supermarket is 3 min walking and we were cooking delicious meals. The boat is very nice, clean, and vivid. Shower is great and no restriction with hot water and good water pressure. Kitchen is equipped with all the appliances necessary for cooking and having meals. Daan is very nice and prompt to address any questions."

785432,80189340.0,6/16/2016,45625427,Teresa,"The host Daan, sent a very friendly and welcoming person by the name of Monica to greet us upon arrival.  She showed us around the houseboat and explained how everything worked and left us to get settled.  The description accurate.  The houseboat was located in a great neighbourhood.  It was close to all amenities."
785432,80301666.0,6/17/2016,58571208,Andrey,"I visited Amsterdam few times on business, but the first time for short holidays. Living on boat gives you an absolutely unique atmosphere and completely different feeling of the city. Great location, beautiful view on the canal from the upper deck. No issues with accommodation. Just need to understand that you are going to live on the boat - do not compare with a hotel staying."
785432,80545043.0,6/18/2016,22157906,Al,"Great houseboat, really loved the location. At a nice deck on the door. Amenities on board the boat was good, and the wifi was sufficiently fast."

"
785432,81221754.0,6/21/2016,19098297,Eric,This is a spectacular accommodation.  You can not possibly experience amsterdam like Daan's boat.  Sitting on the deck in the morning looking at the boats and ducks all floating right by while life on the streets is waking is beyond THE experience for this beautiful city.  The boat has all the luxuries one could possibly imagine on a boat.  Anyone who feels it's lacking anything; is forgetting you are living amsterdam life on a boat!  Thanks Daan - we had a great stay!
785432,81599724.0,6/24/2016,14519382,Leigh,"Daan and Monica were excellent hosts. The houseboat is clean, safe, and has an incredible roof deck for relaxing and taking in the boats driving past. A very unique and cool experience. Daan and Monica were flexible and kind -- we would definitely stay with them again!! "
785432,82152108.0,6/26/2016,22679374,Isil,"We had a great time at Daan's boat. Above all, it's such a unique experience to stay at a boathouse. You may enjoy beatiful sunsets on the terrace and wave passing boats :) The boat is perfectly located. It is too central and also very close to metro and tram stations. The boat was very clean and well equipped. You may find plenty of kitchenware, bed sheets, towels etc. Daan was very friendly showing us all those. The only thing I can say is that the furniture on the terrace may definitely use some renewal. <br/><br/>My parents told me that they'll never forget this beatiful and unique experience of staying at a boathouse. Thank you Daan for making our trip to Amsterdam so special. <br/>"
785432,82639837.0,6/28/2016,5202042,Robert,"Staying on the houseboat was the highlight of Amsterdam! Sitting on the top deck watching canal life flow past was a treat. The boat was spacious and comfortable, and the location is perfect - central but quiet, close to shops, bakeries, transport, and it is right outside the Opera & Ballet.  Our hosts were very friendly and accommodating. Our flight from Australia arrived early and Daan stowed our three bike bikes and three suitcases aboard his own boat so that we could go exploring Amsterdam. When we returned at check-in time, Monica had very kindly installed all our luggage inside the boat for us - thank you! We would recommend this listing if you want to enjoy a special Amsterdam experience."
785432,83034357.0,6/30/2016,37438054,Jeff,Our stay on the houseboat was great.  The host was very responsive and very helpful. The location was also very nice. This is a great spot.

785432,86519719.0,7/16/2016,36548300,Hagen,"We had a great time on Daan's houseboat. The place is very nice and with a walk of a few minutes you can reach everything you need. City center, supermarket, tram, even to the centraal station it is only around 15-20 minutes by foot.<br/>The boat is in a good shape. It was apleasure to sit on the roof terrace in the evening.<br/>I would definetly recommend to stay at Daan's boat, if it is available.<br/>"
785432,87102091.0,7/18/2016,14007520,Kim,"Daan was the perfect host. He greeted us on arrival at the agreed time and was nearby if we needed anything. The houseboat was comfortable for our family of two adults and 2 teenagers.  We could have space for another with the sofa bed. The location for the price is a steal.  We watched the boats of Amsterdam pass by while sitting on the roof deck. We sav d money by having meals on the boat.  There is a supermarket 2 blocks away where you can get food, wine, and beer.  "
785432,87720556.0,7/21/2016,41320565,Jaclyn,"Daan's house boat is the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam! I can not say enough to compliment the houseboat for its location, unique charm and fantastic roof terrace. To watch the boats and people pass by was an amazing experience that my friends and I will never forget. We felt like locals! I will recommend the houseboat to anyone who is visiting Amsterdam and I hope one day to come back to stay! "
785432,88129378.0,7/23/2016,69184073,Brian,Great location.

785432,89264685.0,7/27/2016,47305072,Sue,"We could not have been made more welcome by Daan, who was the perfect and most accommodating host! The houseboat itself far exceeded our hopes - perfect position, every possible home comfort, and the view from the the top seating area was one of the absolute highlights of our trip. The location of the boat was so central, and we were very lucky with the weather, which was also perfect. We are already planning a return trip!"
20168,59572.0,7/1/2010,114288,Jennifer,"The room was much smaller than in the picture, was filled with Mosquitos and was very hot. However, the host was friendly and let us check in an hour early, as well as let us use another rooms shower when our room wasn't ready yet."
785432,89748083.0,7/29/2016,66743638,David,wow is all we can say about this place! Daan was very responsive and welcoming from the beginning. the place was clean and well equipped for anything! the terrace was an amazing addition to our stay on the water. it was located near nightlife and other attractions and we felt safe the entire stay. would stay again in a heart beat.

517996,12102250.0,4/22/2014,8661623,Casey,Staying at Aemilia's was the best AirBnb experience I've had yet. Perfect apartment for one person or a couple in the ideal location in Jordaan. Aemilia was very helpful and accommodating and her place is very charming. Easy walk from Centraal Station and to all maybe sights. Highly recommend!  
517996,16675145.0,7/31/2014,17656147,Bill,"Aemilia's apartment was fantastic, and exactly as described. The apartment was extremely comfortable, clean, and centrally located to everything someone would want to do while in Amsterdam. Having traveled to Amsterdam frequently over the years, this was my first airbnb experience and it was great. Aemilia left a lovely list of things in and around the house, including restaurants, places to visit, and some of her own suggestions. <br/><br/>Aemilia was always quick to respond to an email, and was very accommodating with check in time. We arrived 15 minutes earlier then our check in time, and her sister was there waiting for us. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a great experience, and I would absolutely stay in Aemilia's place again the next time that I have to travel to Amsterdam. "
517996,30334765.0,4/20/2015,30473734,Nicole,"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. The whole experience was just amazing. The apartment was exactly as shown - bright and airy, fully functional kitchen, comfy bedroom and overlooking the grogeous Prinsengracht Canal. It is by far, my favorite neighborhood in Amsterdam - right near Nine Street shopping, and a close to everything else. <br/><br/>Aemilia was a brilliant host. Was there to greet us at the door and walk us up. Didn't tell us anything that we couldn't do, but offered up so many things we could do! She left an incredible list of places to eat, markets to visit and shopping tips. We went to every single one of her recommended restaurants and then asked her for more! She was readily available on text for any questions, although we didn't need to trouble her much. Everything was just fantastic. Had a completely relaxed and inspiring stay.<br/>The next time I am in Amsterdam, will definitely stay here again. "
517996,144748650.0,4/16/2017,124725677,Mercedes,"El apartamento es estupendo, el salón tiene unas vistas muy bonitas a uno de los canales, también tiene una terraza muy agradable y una cocina muy bien equipada. Por ponerle alguna pega, hay que subir escaleras para ir a la habitación y/o al baño (para los que no os hayáis alojado en Amsterdam, las casas tienen unas escaleras de vértigo). No lo aconsejaría para personas mayores y/o niños, aunque es casi imposible evitar escaleras en Amsterdam."
517996,146210547.0,4/22/2017,3136117,Meg,"Aemilia's place is perfect! It couldn't be in a more ideal location, and it is spotless and super comfortable. The outdoor patio is a total bonus if the weather is good! There is absolutely nothing bad to say, it is a gorgeous apartment in the best neighborhood in Amsterdam. Check in was a breeze and communication great throughout. There are 3 flights of super narrow steep stairs but you will not find a building in Amsterdam where it is different! Very typical charming Amsterdam:)"
517996,149215455.0,5/3/2017,67330041,Ekaterina,Everything is as discribed on photos. Well designed apartment close by foot to everything you may want to visit.

Her mum let us into the apartment and was so friendly and helpful! <br/><br/>This was my fourth time in Amsterdam and by far the best place I've stayed at, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has the chance to stay here."
517996,437006146.0,4/14/2019,16163586,Marian,Fantastic living room looking over canal. Well equipped kitchen. A lovely relaxed place to stay in the heart of Amsterdam.

522471,5094803.0,6/11/2013,6742846,Kimberly,Harriet and her boyfriend were the perfect hosts!! They gave us excellent directions to their home and met us at the front door with smiles to welcome us. We got a brief tour of their beautiful home and they even allowed us to ask questions we had about the area. The home is very tidy and spacious. There are tram stops and bus stops right outside the front door. The tram around the corner from them will take you straight to central station so the location is ideal for tourists. The wifi was amazing and her neighbors were very nice. They were very gracious and helpful. If I ever come back to Amsterdam I will be staying with Harriet without a doubt!
522471,5495763.0,7/2/2013,6900361,Rosie,"Harriet's apartment is stylish, spacious and furnished beautifully. It was an absolute pleasure to return to after our busy days. Harriet was extremely welcoming and helpful, and gave us useful advice on travel and places to eat. We particularly loved the two balconies and the roof terrace, not to mention the piano! <br/><br/>Altogether our experience of Amsterdam was fantastic, and this stunning apartment made our holiday. "
785432,91305176.0,8/4/2016,5905041,Iris,"We loved everything about Daan's boathouse.  The location is great, central and accessible yet surprisingly quiet.<br/>The unit had everything we needed for a short stay.  The beds were comfortable and we loved sitting on the deck in the evening with a glass of wine.  Note that to get into the boat you have to walk over another boat, it didn't bother us at all, however I imagine that if there were guests staying at that boat it could have been awkward.  People with limited mobility might find the access a bit challenging.  Not an issue for us.  I definitely recommend."
785432,92844643.0,8/10/2016,24075011,Ken,Staying on the houseboat was a great experience!  It had quite the cool factor and it was in a fantastic location.  I would stay here again for sure!

785432,94997977.0,8/17/2016,3376796,Leah,This was the best decision that my friends and I made. What could be better than staying on a houseboat in Amsterdam? We loved eating our dinner on the deck while watching boats go by. Everything is a short walk or even shorter tram ride. Grocery is very close to make your own meals. Checking in was very easy and Daan allowed us to store our luggage due to our early flight arrival before check in time. He went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure we had a pleasant stay. And also assisted arranging a taxi for our departure.  A great stay!
785432,95108784.0,8/18/2016,23082257,Catherine,"We loved our stay on Daan's houseboat.  Daan greeted us and made sure we had everything we needed.  The interior of the boat met our expectations, while the outdoor space amazed us.  The bench and chairs, situated high up on the deck, provided amazing views of the water, an ornate bridge, and the passing boats.  It was the perfect spot for relaxing and taking in the lively local atmosphere.  Our only regret was that we had booked the boat for just one night, and we had to leave for the airport very early in the morning.  Daan helped by arranging to have a reliable taxi driver pick us up.  <br/><br/>I recommend Daan's boat for visitors who want a memorable visit, smack-dab in the middle of the city.  Stay for more than one night!"
785432,95576008.0,8/20/2016,43008933,Carlos,"This place is everything the description says and more. Incredible location, great views from the deck and a very comfortable stay for my three friends and I. Daan knows what he's doing, and I hope to rent from him again!"
785432,97904116.0,8/28/2016,4191808,John,"This is a really great house boat and my group loved staying here. It is in a good location with many cafes, bars and restaurants nearby with easy accesses to central Amsterdam - we usually walked everywhere. The host Daan was great and made sure we had everything we needed on arrival. The boat house was clean and as described in the description and photos. If you are looking for good value central accommodation in Amsterdam then I can definitely recommend it, I would stay there again!"
785432,98191157.0,8/29/2016,6963887,Halid,"The very best accommodation in Amsterdam. The hosts are super helpful and cheerful.

Group location right in front of the opera and central to a lot of the sights. A canal boat like this one is the best way to experience Amsterdam.

The boat was well equipped and had everything we needed. We really enjoyed the houseboat experience! <br/>The host Daan is very responsive to requests and was very helpful for check-in and check-out. We were welcomed personally and had a little chat with him. <br/>We can totally recommend the houseboat for a unique Amsterdam experience, living and sleeping in a beautiful boat. "
785432,113347110.0,11/12/2016,25888771,Xavier,"Daan est un vote aussi prévenant qu'agréable. Nous avons été très bien accueillis et renseignés. <br/>Une bonne surprise sur place, le bateau était mieux équipé que sur les photos du site (novembre 16): un vrai petit salon nous attendait. Mieux: le hasard faisait que la peinture venait d'être refaite dans certaines pièces. Bref, nous nous y sommes sentis très confortables. <br/>Les plus sensibles remarqueront les grosses poussières sous les lits et dans les accès plus difficiles. Et je déconseille aux fumeurs frileux en hiver. Ca caille sur le Dam ! (mais c'est très bien chauffé à l'intérieur du bateau en revanche). <br/>Pour notre part, nous y avons vécu un séjour de rêve et je me réjouis d'y revenir, entre collègues, entre amis ou en famille !"

20168,9889567.0,1/17/2014,10560656,Francesca,"La camera non era quella delle foto, ma nel complesso era molto carina ed accogliente con vista sulla strada principale.<br/>Purtroppo il nostro problema più grande è che abbiamo avuto la visita di un piccolo topo di città sotto il letto una delle sere in camera. La pulizia era buona, e il propietario è stato premuroso e disponibile in piena notte per aiutarci a risolvere il problema. In ogni caso credo che sia giusto comunicarlo qui, se pur spero che l'episodio non si ripresenti più...<br/>Il bagno e molto piccolo e non ha riscaldamento, in più la piccola finestra è sempre aperta quindi fare la doccia ci è rimasto un pò complicato perchè faceva davvero molto freddo.<br/>La posizione è senz'altro ottima poichè permette di raggiungere ogni attrazione a piedi senza utilizzare i costosissimi trasporti pubblici. Coffee shop, ristoranti italiani e argentini, souvenir, cinema e casinò nelle vicinanze."

The listing was accurate and the boat was lovely & cosy inside. We even had an Xmas tree to put our presents under. 
522471,7721618.0,9/30/2013,8957427,Nicolas,"We enjoyed tremendously the Bitcoin Conference in Amsterdam for 3 days. Our stay was made so much better by having such a nice and well-connected place to come ""home"" to every night.<br/><br/>We had breakfast every morning (after taking luxurious showers) with buns supplied from some of the various bakeries close by. We also used the well-equipped kitchen to cook a nice meal one night. The dishwasher is a godsend.<br/><br/>Thank you Harriet and Roemer, would book again in the blink of an eye.<br/>"

The room was fairly small however the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The only thing bad about the room was that it was situated on a main road and the traffic noise was very loud throughout the night. Other than that, had a pleasant stay. Thanks Alex! "

Il proprietario ci ha dotato di tutto ciò di cui avevamo bisogno, asciugamani e lenzuola pulite, saponi, phon e tv in camera e sopratutto il wi-fi. È in pieno centro, a un passo da tutte le cose più importanti da vedere in città e per gli spostamenti ha la fermata del tram sotto casa. È il posto ideale per vivere un week-end romantico o con  amici ad Amsterdam! Lo consiglio a tutti per l' ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo!!"

We had plenty of room for all 5 of us. There's everything you need in the same street like a bakery, supermarket etc. and it's a 30 min. walk to downtown Amsterdam. We would definitely rent it again :)"

They gave us plenty of information and made sure that every question was answered before leaving us.<br/>We had very nice holidays thanks to Harriet’s house! The place is spacious, and there is a great roof terrace and 2 balconies. The kitchen is beautiful and large, the bathroom is luxurious and the sofa is very comfy :) We also spend a very nice time listening to music with the high quality hifi system.<br/>There is the tram 14 just in front of the house to go directly in the center, and the nightbus 352 so it was very easy to go in the center.<br/>One more time, I wish you all the best for 2014 Harriet!!"
522471,11805285.0,4/15/2014,6308849,Eric,"Harriet was a gracious and lovely host! Her apartment was decorated very nicely and extremely cozy. The upstairs bathroom was very large and very modern with two sinks so two people can use it at once. Her upstairs terrace was great for relaxing in the evenings while looking up at the sky. Her apartment has a piano, guitar, ukulele, and other random instruments which was great for our group because we love playing music. Her kitchen has everything you could need save for a microwave. She let us use and eat anything we found in her kitchen/fridge. She let us help our selves to her coffee beans so we had fresh free coffee every morning. There were three beds (two doubles and one single) which were extremely comfy. She had cable tv, the plugin to hook up to our macbooks so we could watch movies on her tv from our laptops. She also had a record player and sound system that let us hook up our music from all our devices which was awesome! <br/><br/>Upon arrival Harriet gave us a very warm greeting with a tour of her apartment. She was very open to answering and questions of her apartment and any other questions we had in terms of directions and getting around Amsterdam. She was also very easy to contact via text message while we she was away and she responded very quickly. <br/><br/>Thank you very much for letting us stay in your beautiful home Harriet it was a pleasure meeting you!"
522471,14737081.0,6/25/2014,13670256,Margie,"We had a fantastic time!  The flat is beautiful and was very comfortable for our family of 4.  The rooftop deck was a great place to relax in the evenings and we really enjoyed the short walk to the Westergasfabriek to watch World Cup football with enthusiastic Dutch fans.<br/>While we are regular visitors to The Netherlands, this house is a great location if you are visiting Amsterdam for the first time: there is an organic foods store a couple of doors away, 2 supermarkets within 5 minutes walk and several places to grab a quick bite.  And all the bus lines to tourist attractions are one block or less away."
522471,15135049.0,7/3/2014,13780647,Miriam,We rented the appartment of Harriet for a week. We had a wonderful time in Amsterdam. The appartment is located pretty good and a subway station is directly in front. We felt welcomed and the interior is so lovely and inspiring. You can feel really fast at home and relax after a busy day in the city. I loved the styl of the appartment and I'm really jealous about the amazing terrace and the kitchen. It's easy to feel comfortable. Amsterdam is such an amazing city and we were glad that we had the opportunity of renting a private home. Everything was organized in a perfect way and made it easy for us. We wish both of you Harriet and her Husband all the best for their future as a family and maybey we have the chance to spend some time again in your lovely home. All the best from Germany.

Also very close to the tram that takes you to Central Station. <br/><br/>There are small/steep stairs up to the room. This was not a problem for us, but good to know for other travelers! <br/><br/>The bathroom is connected to the room, but is not heated. Once you turn the hot water on, you are fine (but something to keep in mind for traveling during the winter). "

522471,201480318.0,10/8/2017,95233864,Loni,"Harriets Wohnung hat unsere Vorstellung in jeglicher Hinsicht voll erfüllt. Wir haben uns vom ersten Augenblick an zu Hause gefühlt und es war ein unglaublicher schöner Aufenthalt. Die Wohnung ist geräumig, gemütlich und verbindet charmanten Altbau mit moderner Technik und geschmackvoller Architektur. Die Dachterrasse ist wunderbar! Großes Bad, funktionale Küche mit allem, was man braucht. Die gesamte Wohnung ist sehr gepflegt, aufgeräumt und sauber, allergikerfreundlich mit Holzfußböden und Fliesen ausgestattet und nicht zuletzt gibt es ein Klavier, eine Gitarre und einen Plattenspieler, welche das Herz meines musikalischen Mannes sehr erfreuten!<br/><br/>Die Lage war für unseren Amsterdam Besuch absolut perfekt. Verschiedene Linien halten direkt vor der Tür und brachten uns in zehn bis zwanzig Minuten zu allen Sehenswürdigkeiten der Stadt. Hinter dem Haus befindet sich in zwei Gehminuten Entfernung ein wunderbarer weitläufiger Stadtpark, der zum Laufen und Spazierengehen einlädt. Dazu vielfältige Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Restaurants in fußläufiger Entfernung, ein Bäcker direkt nebenan. Wir haben unser Auto im nahegelegenen öffentlichen Parkbaus abgestellt und während unseres Aufenthalts nicht einmal gebraucht. <br/><br/>Die Kommunikation mit Harriet war im Vorfeld und auch während unseres Aufenthaltes hilfreich und warmherzig. Wir erhielten alle nötigen Informationen und detaillierte Tipps zur Wohnung und zur Umgebung. <br/>Harriet ist superlieb, hilfsbereit und eine fantastische Gastgeberin. Wir können ihr Zuhause wärmstens empfehlen und würden diese Unterkunft bei einem weiteren Amsterdam Besuch sofort wieder anfragen. <br/><br/>Vielen herzlichen Dank Harriet und alles Liebe für dich und deine Familie!"

20168,35554468.0,6/20/2015,5363621,Valerie,The place is well located and the room is clean.the wifii didnt work properly on our iphones but thats pretty much the only thing we have to say.I would recommand this place.
20168,35798262.0,6/22/2015,31710574,Riona,"We had a very warm welcome with detailed directions from Alex, and he availed himself to answer all our questions. The room was lovely and had everything we needed and the best part was the location, the tram stop is right outside! I would recommend this to fellow travellers. Thank you Alex for a lovely stay in Amsterdam, we really had an unforgettable time."
20168,36022306.0,6/24/2015,9814509,Haley,"Our stay was great! The room is beautiful and is in a great location. Alex was there to meet us with the keys and answer any questions we had. If I find myself back in Amsterdam, I would definitely stay again. The wifi didn't work very well but other than that, not a complaint to be had!"

20168,36668541.0,6/30/2015,29963216,Chelsea,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Alex's apartment for 2 nights. We were due to arrive at 1.30pm, however missed our flight so didn't arrive until 3.15pm. When I messaged Alex that morning to explain that we would be a couple of hours late because of a missed flight, I got the reply 'well thanks for ruining my plans!!!!!' While I could understand us being late would be annoying for him, this was not a very nice response. <br/>However, once we did get there, we really enjoyed our stay at the apartment!<br/>The bedroom was big, the bed was super comfortable, and the place was very clean. It was in a great location-central, with a tram station right outside if needed. Alex included a map and some touristy information when checking in. The wifi didn't work very well, but the rest of the apartment made up for it. We would recommend this airbnb. <br/><br/>"
522471,230846417.0,1/29/2018,102814096,Margaux,"The apartment is beautiful, clean and really close to Amsterdam Center (20 min by bus)<br/>Beds are confortable, there is everything to cook/live/even play music !<br/>Moreover, the bus to Amsterdam Centraal Station is just in front of the apartment.<br/>Communicate with Harriet was really easy : she quickly answers to messages and gives us a lot of advices! :)"
522471,232183165.0,2/4/2018,60434559,Rabab,Harriet’s place is absolutely wonderful. She is also extremely helpful and accommodating. The location and the apartment itself were great! Transportation options and local amenities galore!
522471,233132737.0,2/8/2018,117588781,Dominic,"This is a lovely apartment with lots of space, a nice kitchen and balconies. It's easy to get into and around the city on the trams and metro. There are some nice restaurants nearby, including Turkish, Indonesian and Thai. Harriet's communication was great. She sent keys in advance and a detailed note full of tips on where to eat nearby and how to get around the city. There were some renovations taking place on the flat below, but the builders were friendly and we had no problems with this."

785432,139182096.0,3/24/2017,82066915,Grégory,"Un bel endroit, très original ( péniche), propre et confirme à l'annonce. On ne sent d'ailleurs pas à détroit dans cette péniche. L'hôte est acceuillant et a passé quelques moments à répondre à nos questions. Péniche propre avec une terrasse avec table t chaise pour prendre l'apéro sur le canal. A faire. Plus cher au'n logement ""normal"" mais tellement plus original. Je recommande pour les couples ou des amis en recherche d'originalité."
785432,139609901.0,3/26/2017,20668998,Alex,"Our stay at Daan's houseboat was great - don't miss the opportunity to have a truly unique Amsterdam experience! You can't beat waking up and enjoying coffee on the roof, watching the boats on the canal float by. Location is fantastic and very convenient. The boat itself is small but very well equipped - Daan has fit all the conveniences of a traditional apartment into the space. Daan was also a great host and was very flexible about our check in, check out, and bag storage - we only spent a few days in Amsterdam and this allowed us to really maximize our time. I highly recommend and hope I can come back to stay again someday!"
785432,140313847.0,3/29/2017,38668238,Sohail,"What an excellent way to experience Amsterdam.  I agree with the other reviewers that the place is great, exactly as described, and with a great host. What really stood out for us was the roof top deck where we sat and enjoyed the wonderful spring weather. There were many boats passing by in the day time but almost none at night. It was a very unique and wonderful way to experience Amsterdam. I would highly recommend it for the new or returning visitor to Amsterdam. "
785432,140480242.0,3/30/2017,56074872,Katrina,We stayed on the boat for one night. Central location and friendly check in.

785432,141849960.0,4/5/2017,41342544,Kate,"We loved sitting on deck in the sunshine drinking Beers, or tea in the morning. So central for everything,we walked to most things, Anne Frank, Van Gogh, Rijkmuseum. My teenage sons enjoyed the DVD collection. We would definitely recommend this houseboat. "
785432,142227812.0,4/7/2017,37441191,Ellen,The view was fabulous and the houseboat is really close to various restaurants and shops.
785432,143022019.0,4/10/2017,78976564,Natasha,"What a wonderful stay! The houseboat was amazing, clean, comfortable with all of the amenities you could possibly want. Check in/out time was flexible and Daan and Monica were so friendly and helpful with any questions we had, and easily contactable. The boat was in a perfect location- so scenically beautiful and 10/15 mins walk to everywhere. You're in the hustle and bustle in 10 mins but where the boat is moored is quiet and peaceful. We will definitely be returning. Thank you Daan! "
785432,143365735.0,4/11/2017,124455708,Ran,"Zeker aan te raden. Super ligging, zeer centraal gelegen. De hele dag zon op het terras van de boot. Goed ontvangen door leuke hosts."
785432,143466334.0,4/12/2017,10976940,Trent,Very great place to stay. Everything is walkable and coordinating the pick up was easy. I would definitely recommend this place for your stay in Amsterdam. Being on the river was a great experience! The houseboat has everything you could need.
785432,143750277.0,4/13/2017,1869614,Samara,"This home was incredible. Right in the middle of everything but quiet. The boat was amazing. Everything needed was there, and it was very comfortable. Everything felt extremely clean and tidy. Wish we could stay longer!"
785432,144023022.0,4/14/2017,4167197,Elizabeth,Daan was perfect host - place was exactly as it said - never thought you could have a bath on a boat! 
785432,145384219.0,4/18/2017,36118001,Anja,Es hat alles perfekt geklappt. Wir hatten eine schöne zeit.
785432,145805509.0,4/20/2017,5183968,Priscilla,"Logement atypique et très bien équipé (literie, vaisselle, nécessaires du quotidien : jeux, livres, mouchoirs, trousse de secours...). Malgré un accès restreint (entrée peu pratique), péniche typique et très agréable. Le vrai plus de cette péniche est, sans conteste, la terrasse avec vue sur l'Amstel. Daan est particulièrement disponible et à l'écoute de ses hôtes. Nous sommes ravis de notre séjour sur cette péniche sans chichis mais vraiment très agréable."
785432,145841806.0,4/20/2017,25238027,Talah,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful boat. <br/>I have always dreamt of staying on a houseboat in Amsterdam whilst visiting over the last few years and Daan's boat did not disappoint. Perfect amount of space with a beautiful terrace and a kind, friendly  and helpful host. The boat is a short walk to dam square but and a nice walk to central station area and the area itself has a lovely market and quiet local spots to relax away from the crowds.<br/>We were worried it may be cold at night but the central heating was more than enough. We cannot wait to return! Thanks Daan! "
785432,146927573.0,4/24/2017,109019414,Romain,Très bon accueil. Très beau séjour. Très beau cadre! La péniche vaut le coup!
785432,147667811.0,4/28/2017,12439979,Gareth,"If your visiting Amsterdam this is the way to do it! The pictures don't do it justice. We had a delayed flight and didn't end up getting to the boat till nearly midnight and was still met with smiles and a warm boat, which was perfect! Will definitely stay here again. "
785432,148200099.0,4/30/2017,89055774,Mona,Very good time in Amsterdam!!<br/>Lovely boat with a beautiful lookout. <br/>Thank you for your help
785432,148635667.0,5/1/2017,42171009,Amanda,Dawn's houseboat was wonderful! The place was just as pictured. Very clean and tidy. Fully stocked with dishes if you want to eat in but also close to a lot of great restaurants. My husband and I enjoyed sitting on top of the boat watching the canal and city alive with activity. It was really a great night! 
785432,149416505.0,5/4/2017,112675797,Alicia,Daan has a true gem on the water in Amsterdam! I came on a trip with my girlfriends and the 4 of us were extremely comfortable. The location is fantastic and Daan is an accommodating host. I can't wait to bring my husband back to enjoy Amsterdam and a stay on Daan's boat. <br/>Cheers!
785432,150092157.0,5/7/2017,11509038,Sten,"All you need for a perfect week-end is in this boat. If you are lucky and the sun is there, the terrace is also a great place to spend the rest of the afternoon after a bike tour. Daan is very welcoming and we felt like locals on our private boat. Also the place is safe and guarded by cats."
785432,150924815.0,5/10/2017,107944219,Terry,"Great location right next to metro and tram stops. On the river with a lot of scenic traffic during the day, but the noise stops at night and it was very quiet and peaceful. We were within a 20 minute walk to Riksmuseum, Anne Frank and the Central train station. Five minutes to the flower market and all it its restuarants and bars. Place is comfortable, not flashy, but clean, warm and plenty of hot water. Overall a great choice and host Daan lives two boats over and was always available when we called him. You cannot be better for the price."
785432,151784453.0,5/14/2017,52207851,Allan,Perfect location. 
785432,152954336.0,5/19/2017,31429714,Eileen,"Daan's houseboat was definitely a highlight of our trip. The location is great and close to lots of cute cafes and shops. Daan was a great host, very friendly and personable and had lots of helpful info. Thanks for the hospitality Daan!"
785432,153463349.0,5/21/2017,10538267,Jamie,Great location. Very clean. Everything you need on board! Great trip!
785432,155405887.0,5/28/2017,19088303,Amy,"We enjoyed an amazing weekend on the houseboat. The perfect spot to set up base and explore the city. We had amazing weather so the roof terrace was a very much appreciated perk! The boat was clean, tidy and had all the amenities we needed. Daan and Nathalie were great hosts. I couldn't recommend staying here enough."
785432,156996233.0,6/2/2017,62380194,Shawn,"Renting a houseboat in Amsterdam we had high expectations when we arrived.  The boat actually exceeded all of our expectations.   It was surprisingly spacious, had all the amenities you need, was in a great quiet location and the patio was awesome for sitting with a drink and watching the boats go by.  Awesome experience!"
785432,158298739.0,6/6/2017,27770735,Wolfgang,"Wir haben ein wunderschönes Wochenende in Amsterdam verbracht und Daans Hausboot hat dazu wesentlich beigetragen. Er ist ein perfekter Gastgeber, zurückhaltend, freundlich, entspannt. Das Hausboot ist sauber, gut ausgestattet und perfekt gelegen für kulturelle und kulinarische Ausflüge: U-Bahn, Straßenbahn, Radverleih und Innenstadt gleich ums Eck. Auf der Terrasse zu sitzen und dem Bootscorso zuzuschauen, das ist schon einmalig. Wir kommen wieder!"
785432,158908234.0,6/9/2017,60288972,Rob,"We loved our stay at Daan's houseboat and would stay again. <br/><br/>The houseboat is centrally located and very near a metro stop and a lot of things to do. During the day, the water is quite lively and you can watch the boats go by from the deck. At night, it is very quiet and easy to get a good night's sleep.<br/><br/>Inside, it's small but there was enough room for our family (2 adults, 2 teenagers). The kitchen is decently equipped and we were able to make breakfast and tea each day without problem.  Things (such as the refrigerator) are strangely located due to the space limitations of the houseboat, but you get used to it in a day or so.  You have to be a bit agile to get inside due to the steep stairs but that wasn't an issue for us. The wifi worked well. The beds are firm and comfortable and there is a small living area to relax in. The bathroom is adequate. <br/><br/>Overall, we had a very nice stay and I would stay there again. "
20168,37141915.0,7/5/2015,29872225,Darryll,Alex was an excellent host. He greeted us and gave us a quick overview of rules and things we needed to know about our location.  Alex was excellent with communication and always responded my texts promptly. The house is centrally located and very convenient. He was wonderful as my first Airbnb experience and I would absolutely stay with him again.  
20168,37464943.0,7/7/2015,32834438,Morgan,The room is at a great location and very easy to get to from Central Station. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend. 
20168,37649849.0,7/9/2015,19533921,Sean,"Alex's house is extremely central and the bed is the highlight of the rooms, extremely comfortable. Alex accommodated our request for evening check-in and provided maps and tourist information for the city. However, the Wi-Fi signal is weak and could be strengthened and the stairwell to the rooms is steep, narrow and has low headroom.  Knowing this, I would stay here again and recommend it to friends."
20168,38258194.0,7/14/2015,29888294,Brittany,"Beautiful flat in Amsterdam! It was the perfect location. Alex was there to greet us and was very helpful. The internet was slow, but overall I would definitely recommend this flat. "
20168,38833169.0,7/19/2015,22777843,Saraf,"Alex was a lovely host. The location is excellent, walking distance to many attractions. We really enjoyed our stay."
20168,39291352.0,7/22/2015,10081816,Manasi,"Alex's place was in a great location, walking distance from everywhere. The apartment was very nicely furnished and quiet despite being on a main road. We enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to others! "
20168,39612572.0,7/25/2015,14250811,Laura,"Central location - walking distance to almost everything! <br/>There is a bar fridge however there isn't any kitchen facilities or bowls/cutlery etc so this is only really useful if you wanted to keep drinks cold etc unless you bring your own utensils. We ate breakfast down stairs at the local cafe as we were told we would get a special discount if we mentioned we were staying with Alex - for two breakfasts we only got a 1 euro discount that, for a 28 euro bill, wasn't that much in the scheme of things. I would recommend exploring elsewhere as we found you could get much cheaper breakfasts at other cafes around Amsterdam. However, this cafe wasn't bad and the coffee was yum. The room was clean and tidy and the bed was very comfortable. Alex gave us a quick run down of everything on the first day and then was never to be seen again which, to be honest, was nice as it felt like we weren't sharing with anyone! It's like a studio apartment minus the kitchen and laundry! Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, thank you Alex."
20168,39926678.0,7/27/2015,33119605,Bijal,"The room was pleasant and clean. Bed was comfortable. Location was very good and central to site seeing in Amsterdam. However it was on a main road so we could hear the road with the window open. <br/>Shower was good temperature and easy to use, however just be aware the bathroom itself is very very small (a larger sized person might struggle)<br/>Meant to meet Alex at 12, we arrived few minutes early,  rang the doorbell and continued to ring it intermittently over the next 30 minutes.  He did not respond and we had to ask the hotel next door to use the wifi so we could contact him. We were waiting outside in the rain and when he opened the door, he didn't seem very apologetic and made a comment that because we arrived early he wasn't to hear the doorbell.He didn't offer to help with our bags,  and again for anyone considering this air bnb should be aware the stairs are spiralling, narrow and steep. Once in the room, he went through information with us and was very quick to get the city tax from us and ask when we would check out. He did ask us if we had any more questions and gave us the opportunity to ask however because of how.our interaction begun,  we felt we couldn't really ask. Overall I would not rate this place for hosting skills to enhance your experience when visiting Amsterdam as we found it very transactional and impersonal and as if we were a burden however the room itself is perfectly pleasant and good if your just looking for a place to stay."
20168,41066184.0,8/4/2015,6565851,Marcus,We had a marvelous stay in Amsterdam and a nice room. The location is perfect and it's easy to reach all important and less important sightseeing places. However please keep in mind the room is located next to a big street with its typical traffic and noise. Nevertheless we enjoyed our stay! Thank you!
20168,41364608.0,8/7/2015,34608309,Natalie,The location of this apartment is perfect. Walkable distance to everything and we loved the bakery below. Alex was extremely nice and helpful. The place was very modern and clean. We highly recommend to anyone staying in Amsterdam.

20168,42707978.0,8/15/2015,33905504,Nigel,"A  cheerful welcome from Alex, information about getting around the city and quick tour of the dos and don'ts. The room and ensuite are great and the traffic noise no problem.<br/>Don't be put off by an apartment close to the centre; Amsterdam is a wonderfully compact, clean and friendly city with millions of clean, quiet bicycles. Pretty much everyone speaks English (and they aren't offended if you don't speak Dutch) and are incredibly helpful.<br/>You can hire a bike, but the combination of :  millions of others, other side of the road, an unfamiliar bike and maybe a beer or two is not likely to be relaxing. The city is small enough to explore on foot or buy a day ticket for the brilliant public transport system.<br/>Have fun, Nigel"
20168,43360267.0,8/19/2015,22372373,David,This place was fantastic. Walking distance from everything you'd want to visit in Amsterdam! Alex was very efficient and helpful. Would stay here again ! 
20168,44316495.0,8/25/2015,37838735,Natalie,"The room is exactly as pictured, a small but bright and comfortable room.  Do note that the bathroom is quite small but manageable.  Alex's friend met us to check in and was at least 30 minutes late.  That being said, Alex was easily reachable by phone and resolved the situation.  The bed was very comfortable and we had a great stay in this place.  Would stay again and would highly recommend!"
20168,45102126.0,8/31/2015,10068148,Andy,"The host turned up on time to hand over the keys and explain a few things. The location is very central. The noise is not too bad considering it is on one of the main streets with trams. Towels, shampoo and soap were provided."
20168,45953666.0,9/7/2015,4126783,Leandra,The studio is exactly as described. Alex was there to give us the keys and explain everything. The bathroom is very small but it's alright for a short stay. My friend and I really enjoyed staying there and I would recommend this place to everyone who plans a short stay in Amsterdam and wants to live central.

785432,160305221.0,6/13/2017,125875185,Adrienne,Daan is friendly and easy to communicate with. He even coordinated an early drop off of our bags so that we could walk about the city without our backpacks. The houseboat itself is in an amazing location and is comfortable and beautiful. I hope to return to Daan's as soon as I can!
785432,160658785.0,6/15/2017,114894447,Christy,What a great place to stay while in Amsterdam. Sitting on the deck of a houseboat watching people go by. I would recommend this to anyone. 
785432,161443282.0,6/18/2017,8086880,Lea,Comfortable boat in super central location close to public transport and main sights. Daan was very helpfull and easy to communicate with.

785432,162578049.0,6/21/2017,33778794,Ahmad,"Daan is a great host, he was flexible and easy to reach. He made our stay pleasent by offering some suggestions in the neighbourhood. The houseboat is great, good space for 3-4 people, and is centrally located to all the major attractions. Great spot, great host. "

785432,164644718.0,6/28/2017,111902364,Gina,"This was such a lovely stay! Brought my old parents with me. Getting in and out of the boat was a bit different, but if my 73 year old dad and my mom with 5 screws in her neck can do it... Be careful at night! The spiders start to come out, so close the windows by the terrace! It's so easy to get around with the opera house as your target to get home to. People will play music outside and you can hear it on the terrace. There's plenty of coffee shops in walking distance, shops, and EXTREMELY close to public transport. Loved everything about this stay. The duvet in the room to the left is SO comfortable. Had the best sleep of my whole trip here....could've been the  coffee shops though! 😊 I will definitely be back to this boat in the future. "

522471,251513878.0,4/8/2018,111783691,James,We really enjoyed the time we spent at Harriet's apartment. It is well positioned close to the city centre and is in a nice area with some shops. Harriet was also really helpful when booking and sent us a lot of useful information about the city and local area.
20168,48163897.0,9/24/2015,32938213,Nathan,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Everything was as promised. It is close to all the main attractions and we found we walked everywhere during our three night stay. It is approx 5-10mins walk to Dam Square. The room is roomy, well furnished, and had good security having to enter through two lockable doors. The bed is very comfortable, not to soft but not rock hard either. It has a cosy shower and toilet that is your own. There was little to no noise during the day or night. Alex was friendly and provided us with the information we needed. Next time we visit Amsterdam we will definitely be staying here. Great work Alex. Stayed as a couple from Sydney Australia."
20168,49598551.0,10/5/2015,35534159,Carly,"Lovely room, great location. The bed was really comfortable and room very spacious. Shower was  nice and hot. Five minutes walk to shops and restaurants. Only thing would say negatively is that the room lighting is very dim so we found it difficult to get ready in the evening, and the Internet signal was not great."
20168,49907901.0,10/7/2015,43357448,Tegpal,"Alex is very nice, helpful, and informative. The room was nice and cozy. It was very quiet and peaceful. There is a coffee shop below, which is very convenient. Everything is walking distance and the tram stops right in front of the house. The only thing was we heavily relayed on WiFi, but the signal was very low and you would only get WiFi in certain areas of the room."
20168,50165898.0,10/10/2015,32962059,Sarah,"Really loved Amsterdam and the apartment made it all the more enjoyable for us. It's very centrally located, so we didn't use transport once other than to and from the station. It was clean, and spacious. The bathroom is slightly small, but we knew that up front and it didn't make the stay unbearable at all. Alex accommodated us with an early check in for no additional costs and was easily accessible throughout our stay. He was very welcoming and forthcoming with information about Amsterdam to make our stay better! Thanks for an amazing experience Alex."
20168,50627859.0,10/13/2015,40345406,Avril,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 3 nights and it was ideal. The location meant we could walk everywhere around the city although the metro did stop right outside. Lovely, clean apartment. Would definitely recommend staying here. "
20168,50777582.0,10/14/2015,44488161,Dorian,"I enjoyed the stay at Alex's place. The room was clean, smart and well presented. Handy for central Amsterdam, and handy for breakfast.. Alex was very accommodating even when I ended up running late to meet him. Will most likely use the room again."
20168,51718232.0,10/24/2015,33604452,Vera,"La habitacion es tal cual se muestra en la foto. Con un baño pequeño. Esta muy bien ubicado, cerca de todo. En una avenida muy transitada con lugares lindos para pasear y comer. Alex nos explico todo y fue muy amable. Recomendamos."
20168,52062418.0,10/26/2015,35320132,George,"Alex' s place is in an ideal location for a visit to Amsterdam because of the great central location,  <br/>Alex was very helpful in accommodating my daughter and her boyfriend on their first trip away on their own and the security of the property helped to make them feel safe and very comfortable <br/>Highly recommended "
20168,52321993.0,10/28/2015,22473069,Lisa,"The listing was as described; simple and clean, w Windows that were able to block out the noise from below. We were located close to many of the more important sites Amsterdam, but i think staying in a quieter and less touristy spot may have be preferable.  <br/><br/>Alex was rather unpleasant to work with. He wanted to know the ""exact"" time we would be arriving in Amsterdam, which can be somewhat difficult when traveling.  He seemed agitated and rushed, and his entire demeanor left us w an unpleasant feel for our surroundings. "
20168,52421511.0,10/29/2015,44686127,Laura,"Alex was a gracious host and the room is just as the picture. The location is fantastic, close to everything and the city is very easy to navigate. Alex was also very helpful with suggestions! "
20168,52987115.0,11/3/2015,32949479,Tom,"The apartment is in a great location and is perfect for a city break on a budget. Alex was very friendly and welcoming despite the fact we were late for check-in (air bnb's map led us slightly astray for finding the door - it's further from the corner than the map suggests but is clearly  numbered, we were just being a bit absent minded)."
20168,53463432.0,11/9/2015,43153224,Nicole,"Alex was extremely welcoming, waiting up for us due to our late arriving flight. When we did finally arrive, he showed us our room, explained how everything worked and gave us a map of Amsterdam, telling us where the best places to go were. He was very helpful!"
20168,53961073.0,11/15/2015,36887696,Charlie,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay at Alex's. Even though we arrived early, Alex was very welcoming and was happy to show us around our room. We were given a map and showed the best places  to visit/eat and Alex even gave us an adapter because we forgot to bring our own. This apartment is very conveniently located, we walked everywhere and only got a tram once from the station when we first arrived. The bed was extremely comfy and the shower was really good too. Alex even put up a little Christmas tree which made the room look even nicer. We would definitely stay here again if we returned to Amsterdam! :)"
20168,54788311.0,11/23/2015,11226673,Camille,"This room is perfect for a short stay in Amsterdam. Great location in the city center, nice quarter, quiet and safe. The room was very comfortable, warm and welcoming. Alex has been a very nice host. I definitely recommend this place. "
20168,54988317.0,11/27/2015,45592471,Luke,"Alex was very welcoming and helpful. The room is in a great location, it has a cafe underneath which is ideal for breakfast. The room was amazing, exactly what the pictures looked like. Bed was really comfortable and nice bedding. Room is perfect for a short break to Amsterdam!"
20168,55394687.0,12/1/2015,7447604,Asli,"The flat is at a very convenient location, in walking distance to many attractions as well as the city centre, and if you feel like taking the tram there is a station right in front of the building, which was practical on the way from and to the train station, with the luggages. I was arriving early and Alex was nice enough to let me check in earlier. The private bathroom is a plus, it's a small one but there's nothing too inconvenient, especially for a short stay. There's a small fridge in the room as well, and everything was clean and neat. The apartment is on one of the main streets but the room was impressingly quiet at night. "
522471,299518910.0,7/31/2018,132649049,Jean,"Gorgeous appartment, brightfull, with plenty of room and a roof-top terrace that you'll enjoy a lot ! <br/>Nice and quiet neighborhood, with easy access to every public transport right at the door. The city center is at a 15-20 minutes comute. <br/>Harriet is really kind, available, and will give you tips for restaurants, places to see, etc...<br/>I would book there again ! "
522471,494418858.0,7/24/2019,26148275,Subhasis,"We visited Amsterdam in July 2019 with our 2 children (7 &4). Harriet was an incredibly generous host. She was always so easy to reach and check on any questions. She would respond rightaway. We enjoyed staying in their apartment and got to enjoy their amenities and space. It's quite a spacious apartment, good for a family of 4 with young children. The terrace upstairs is a nice place to unwind after a long day on a summer night. The bathroom was clean and updated.<br/>The livng room, kitchen have large windows with a lot of light and breeze. So some nights we stayed in and had dinner while kids played after a busy day of exploring Amsterdam. There are lots of restaurants/cafes around, so we could easily  go for a dinner or bring stuff to the apartment. The connectivity on buses, trams are super easy from this apartment. <br/>Overall a safe neighborhood, lovely apartment with artistic taste and great access to public transportation.<br/>The only point of surprise for us was that we didnt quite expect a long 4 stairs of climb to the apartment with heavy bags. But that wasnt a frequent need, so not a big deal.<br/>Thank you Hariett and family for letting us have a great experience of Amsterdam from your lovely apartment<br/>Subhasis"
522471,500456205.0,8/2/2019,222884229,Ann,"This home is comfortable, clean and well appointed for children and adults. It is very conveniently located for getting onto the city centre, parks and children's playgrounds and the 80 bus goes straight to the beach."
522471,6.1932e+17,5/4/2022,44989224,Jason,Great place very cozy! Nice size roof deck. Quiet neighborhood with everything you need. Harriet was responsive & accommodated me with an early check in
522471,6.9613e+17,8/18/2022,32008643,Franxesca,"Harriet's place was bright and clean and she was a communicative host.<br/>There is plenty of space as well as 1.5 baths which was great because it was difficult to find listings with additional bathrooms.<br/>Be aware that the apartment is about 2 miles from the more touristy parts of Amsterdam. There are some cute restaurants on the water nearby as well as Erasmus park which seems to be a more local hangout (and a great place to swim in the canal). Don't expect the neighborhood to feel like the parts of Amsterdam you've likely seen in photos. The extra space and lack of traffic were worth it for my group, but be prepared to take public transport or taxis or walk into the center each day.<br/>One more thing to be aware of (which we were unprepared for but seems common for airbnbs here) is that all storage space as well as a room downstairs were full of personal belongings. There weren't drawers or cupboards available for storage.<br/>Otherwise the space was large and comfortable with lots of natural light, and we were happy with our stay."
20168,55942223.0,12/7/2015,6225300,Samanta,"Accomodation true to the description and photos - very nice interior, if windows closed - very silent and can't hear any street noise. Very central as well - everything seemed a walk away and we saw a lot of Amsterdam by foot. Bedding super comfortable ! Alex was very friendly and ready to help ! The little café downstairs is a nice plus. Thank you for the wonderful long weekend."
20168,56236513.0,12/11/2015,14217618,Adam,My wife and I stayed 2 nights at Alex's listing and the location was amazing barely a 5 minute walk from the centre of Amsterdam. Our train arrived late which I feel terrible about holding Alex up but he was lovely and very understanding he gave us a run down of how things worked and left us be. The room was huge and bed was amazingly comfortable. Would stay again in a heart beat and highly recommend.
20168,56483271.0,12/14/2015,31639419,Bobbi,"Alex was welcoming and helpful. The room was just as we expected and in a great location in Amsterdam in the middle of all the main attractions, nothing was too far. Would definitely stay here again if I returned to Amsterdam. Thanks alex x "
20168,56724846.0,12/17/2015,15393234,Ethel,This was a cosy place in an excellent location. Enjoyed being able to walk everywhere we needed and the bed was very comfortable. Only little issue was the 5% city tax at the start which we weren't aware of as its not on the listing but it was a small fee and we let Alex know to clarify for next time. Other than that it was a nice little convenient space. 
20168,58800768.0,1/5/2016,21149265,Steven,"By far the best lodging experience I have ever had! All the reviews before me about Alex and the place was right on. The location of the place is great, short walking distance to Amsterdam's flower market and on the major trams way. Alex was very professional, explanatory from the beginning I contacted him and during my stay. The room was exactly how it was described in the pictures and extremely clean. I would definitely stay there if I go back to Amsterdam again. Thanks again to Alex and Airbnb for helping with my stay!"
20168,58972549.0,1/5/2016,30958054,Emma,"The room looks exactly like the photos, the bed is very comfortable and big. Perfect location, you can walk everywhere."
20168,59278562.0,1/9/2016,45277297,Mattia,The room was like the photos! Very clean and big enough for two persons. Perfect location you have all around the room without take any transport. We would definitely stay there if we go back to Amsterdam again. Thanks Alex!
20168,59573618.0,1/12/2016,29987475,Hannah,Thanks for a fantastic few days. The apartment was very clean and beautifully furnished. Great location with everything in walking distance. Alex was very helpful and flexible. Would definitely recommend for a short break in Amsterdam!  
20168,59704008.0,1/14/2016,36703304,Ashley,"The location of the room is very good. And the space of the room was quite big. But the bathroom is very small and cold. Also, the communication was not very pleasant. I've been living in 10+ airbnb and this host is by far the worst one. He seems to be impatient about answering my questions and explaining things in detail."
20168,60004137.0,1/18/2016,4624591,Anna,"We stayed one night on a layover.<br/><br/>Alex was friendly and easy to get in touch with. He waited for us at the apartment, talked us through various things such as using the shower, the keys, and other things, and left us to explore the city. As we were in Amsterdam for only one night, we didn't need to get in touch with him a lot, but for those few times that we had to talk to him, he promptly responded by text.<br/><br/>In general, the room was comfortable. The bed was great, and, although we didn't need to use it, it was good to know that we had access to a mini-fridge. <br/><br/>Our only concern was the bathroom. The toilet seat was located so high that it wasn't very comfortable to use. My girlfriend's feet, for instance, could not reach the floor when she was sitting down. We didn't mind this problem too much because we stayed at the room for such a short amount of time, but someone who stays there longer might find the toilet to cause them more discomfort.<br/><br/>So, while I would recommend this place for a short visit to Amsterdam, I don't know if one would find it comfortable to deal with the bathroom on a longer trip."
20168,60765659.0,1/27/2016,27928859,Sarah,"Loved everything about Alex's place! Excellent communication, perfect location and everything was clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend staying here if you are in Amsterdam!"
20168,60912667.0,1/29/2016,20031193,Céline,Just like the photos. Very well located and perfectly clean. Perfect to stay a couple of days in Amsterdam.
20168,61168054.0,2/1/2016,50892280,Tom,"Absolutely loved our stay here. Perfect location, everything's within walking distance. The room was just like the photos, very cosy and the bed was comfortable. It's above a nice little cafe too - the hallway always smelled of coffee. Alex met us when we arrived and was really helpful in talking us through everything. Will most likely stay here again in the future. "
20168,61375350.0,2/3/2016,51353381,Joni,"The room was identically like the pictures. The location couldn't be better. No need for public transport, everything is in walking distance. Alex gave us a quick tour, a map and showed us the main areas to visit. There's also a little café underneath the room where you can have breakfast. We had a nice time!  "
20168,61439175.0,2/4/2016,28154632,Debora,"The room was very nice and clean (exactly as it looks on all the pictures). Centrally located, which was a huge plus! Small downsides of the room were the not so very strong wifi connection, not being able to store or luggage after check-out, and the cold bathroom. Alex also wasn't there when we checked out, and he never answerred on the text message we sent when we left. Therefore we had to assume everything was okay. Even though there was no possibility of storing our luggage for the rest of the day after we checked out, Alex suggested we asked to store it at the cafe on the ground floor right under the room. It was a really cosy cafe where we had a coffee, smoothie and breakfast and the lady was kind enough to store our bags until closing time. If I go back to Amsterdam, I would definitely consider going back to this Airbnb! "
20168,61799938.0,2/8/2016,15578964,Ching-Wen,"We didn't have the opportunity to meet Alex. It was his friend coming to meet us. The room was great, good location, clean and spacious. Highly recommended."

20168,62073062.0,2/11/2016,39628821,Samm,"A cosy apartment in close distance to everything the centre of Amsterdam has to offer: a stones throw away from the Flower Market and Museum quarter. <br/><br/>The bed is super comfortable, and the room is decorated to a high standard. The fridge is a welcome addition, perfect for storing drinks and a few goodies. <br/><br/>Alex was a great host, and very accommodating. He provided us with a map and orientated us as well as giving us tips on where to go. Although we didn't need him, it's great to know he's available to answer queries 24/7. Thank you Alex! <br/><br/>In Amsterdam, it's worth visiting the Artis Zoo. We also discovered the Dutch Resistance Museum close by the Zoo, which provides a poignant insight into Amsterdam in World War 2- a must to visit.  <br/><br/>The only downside was the small bathroom: the toilet is a little high for those challenged with height, and the shower a little small. This didn't impact our time at all, and being on a short break meant the bathroom was not of massive concern. <br/><br/>Finally, have euros prepared for the tourist tax to pay upon arrival. <br/><br/>In all, a wonderful apartment to have spent our time in Amsterdam.

20168,63715340.0,2/26/2016,13586559,Grace,"Our host was very helpful although he asked me to pay the city tax in cash to him at check in, even though I had already paid it through AirBNB. I thought this was a bit sketchy as really AirBNB hosts should never ask for extra cash without having disclosed that up front. When I explained I already paid it he didn't press it but I still thought it was unprofessional. However the room is as it looks and as the description says, it's very comfortable and great location.

The boat was very cozy and it was a great experience to stay there. Els is a super nice host and we would love to come back some day, Thank you!"
528022,108471261.0,10/16/2016,38329648,Desara,Living for a few days in a boat is surely a very nice experience.  The place where the boat is located is nice and quite.  The room looks exactly like in the photos.

Clean and lightly. The view is amazing!<br/><br/>Das Zimmer ist genau wie auf den Bildern. Els ist eine super Gastgeberin. Sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. <br/>Jeder der mal was anders erleben will sollte aufs Hausboot.  Nur das Dusche und Toilette zusammenliegen ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig :D

Das Badezimmer ist sehr klein aber auch vollkommen ausreichend.<br/>Die Lage ist perfekt um die Stadt zu Fuß oder mit dem Fahrrad zu erkunden. Wir werden bei unserem nächsten Aufenthalt  in Amsterdam wieder bei Alex übernachten.<br/>Wir waren sehr zufrieden. "
20168,65152845.0,3/11/2016,5281612,Taylor,"Alex was a great host. He worked with us because we had an usually early arrival into Amsterdam and was welcoming from the moment we arrived at his house. <br/><br/>The room is very close to everything in the city center. It is about a 5-15 minute walk or tram ride to nearly every place of interest in the city. And if you choose to take the tram, there is a stop directly in front of Alex's entrance. <br/><br/>Alex provided us with a map of Amsterdam and gave us some advice, but left us alone to explore thereafter. He was always available if we needed to contact him though. <br/><br/>The bathroom was quite small, though this seems to be common in Holland and the street grew louder at night the closer it got to the weekend. But overall no complaints. Would definitely stay here again. "
20168,65811006.0,3/17/2016,46793178,Robin,"Alex met us when we arrived and showed us around and explained the keys.  This was a bit rushed, but was very clear; and when I called a few minutes later with a question he'd already answered he was very kind. <br/>The bed and linens are nicer than in my own home, so that was a treat!  The bedroom is spacious and the bathroom is tiny but has everything you need, including plenty of hot water. <br/>The location is ideal: easy walking distance to the major museums and historic Amsterdam.  We had a wonderful time and would happily stay here again on future trips to Amsterdam."

Tram stop just in front of the place which is very comfortable. <br/><br/>We didn't meet Alex but his friend Jan came to greet us, very helpful and kind person . He gave us some special tips and places to visit and kept contact till the end. <br/><br/>The only things I would add to this place considering that it's not a cheap place are an electric kettle and some cups and glasses. The shower curtain should be changed into a glass one as it's very annoying having it sticked  with you while you're showering in a small shower . I don't find it fair to have to pay for the towels and linen if you need them to be changed before 4 days or so (I don't exactly remember the days ) . <br/><br/>Please note that I would still book this place if I make it back to amsterdam . :)"

The room was very clean and spacious, bed was comfortable, location was central (tram stop was literally a couple steps outside the door but with the beautiful weather that day we just walked around Amsterdam instead) and Alex was friendly and super prompt to reply us whenever we needed anything! Also loved the fact that there was a lovely quaint little cafe just downstairs which served good coffee and cakes.<br/><br/>Only down side was that as with any typically older buildings in Amsterdam, the sound proofing wasn't great.  So you could hear your neighbours walking above you in the middle of the night.  And it would've been nice if there was a kettle in the room.  But all things that were bearable during our stay. <br/><br/>Would still definitely recommend staying here anytime.  "
20168,77782320.0,6/3/2016,20014452,Lynda,"<br/>Flat was as described. Location was great with tram stop right outside. Our flight was delayed by an hour so we exchanged texts with Alex (who lives above) and his hand over was therefore a bit rushed but it was clear. Tight spiral staircase to flat but rail to hold onto. Bed large and comfortable. Bathroom very small but adequate. Would have loved a kettle and mugs so we could make a hot drink and glasses that fit under the tap to drink water.  Fridge was a bonus. Cafe for coffee/breakfast is next door and plenty of eating places nearby.  Make sure you get the hang of the window opening as it's a bit stiff."

She lives on the boat, too  - and has for more than 30 years - but there are separate entrances for the two compartments. She did invite us to a lovely evening talking and drinking tea in her living quarters, but there was always plenty of privacy, too. Highly recommended!"

The room is very confortable and there is plenty of good food included for breakfast. Els is very kind and helpfull. <br/>We felt good at her home and all over the city.<br/><br/>We recommend this experience."
20168,86059225.0,7/14/2016,41095073,Jakob,"We were in Amsterdam for the first time.<br/>The room was as described. The location is very central and easy to find. A tram stop is right in front of the door. The staircase is spiral and very narrow (not easy to get bigger suitcases up). The room itself is located on the second floor. Double bed - very large and very comfortable. The bathroom is very small but clean and well maintained with a small window. There is also a small fridge available and some glasses.<br/>A Café is located directly downstairs in the building with good breakfast offers.<br/>Only Con was that only one window in the room can be opened (and that only tilted). WiFi has adequate speed (you can choose from 3 Accesspoints).<br/>Our host Alex was nice and friendly and gave us a quick introduction to the appartment and Amsterdam in general. Overall it was a great stay and a top location to discover the city."
20168,87043602.0,7/18/2016,4569457,Anna,It was really nice stay in Alex place. The place has perfect location and is very clean and comfortable. We had great contact with Alex from the moment I booked the room till the moment we left. He was very responsive and helpful. He even made room available a bit earlier which was great! There is a fridge in the room and all the basics. This place is definitely worth recommendation!
20168,89384339.0,7/28/2016,10338787,Paul,Great location and place! Everything was super easily accessible by walking. It was really nice of Alex to give us the rundown on places to hit up and things to watch out for when we first checked in.

20168,98381268.0,8/30/2016,21741210,Manuel,"My girlfriend and I had a nice stay at the room Alex is offering, we didn't meet Alex in person though. The Place is close to the center and the tram/bus stop so the place is great if you are looking for a central space to sleep. It doesn't have the personal touch and flair of a private apartment, more of a hostel room. I guess it was built just for airbnb purposes. We can recommend it anyways to all sorts of travellers!"
20168,98646182.0,9/1/2016,22765498,Cedric,"A perfect room, so clean and especialy the location, few minutes walk from all the sightseeing, and a trmway stop just nxt to the door, i will definitely book it again."
20168,99456743.0,9/4/2016,49952788,Jess,"Alex's place was amazing! He was away at the time, but Connor greeted us and he was very friendly and welcoming :) <br/>The room itself was great. Spacious enough for two people, with anything you could need. The bed was incredibly comfortable. <br/>The location of the room is perfect, so easy to walk to everywhere we wanted to go. So many restaurants and bars nearby and only like a 10 min walk right into the centre of Amsterdam. <br/>Thanks so much to Alex and Connor for having us stay, we would definitely stay there again :) "

20168,102797875.0,9/19/2016,87205051,Niklas,"Lovely and cozy appartment with walking distance to ""almost everything"" the city of Amsterdam has to offer. We didn't need to use any money on public transportation during our stay. The only con with the appartment is the ventalation. <br/>There was only one window we could open for fresh air, and the appartment felt really warm on several occasions. "
20168,105228350.0,9/30/2016,13221915,Diana,"The room is nice and clean. There is enough space and although it faces a busy street the windows do its job to keep the noise out. The bathroom is a bit smaller but manageable for a few days stay. The shower varied in temperature and pressure, but also okay. Conor, who was there at our arrival was very pleasant and helpful, which was a great surprise because from my previous communications Alex (the host), was impatient in settling the check in time and when I kindly asked if it was possible to change it, he said ""too many changes, fine now but will not change anymore"". I thought that was rude since I had not asked to change it before. But anyway, we ended up not meeting him and that's why I said meeting Conor was a nice surprise. The location is great. I recommend it!"
20168,106248873.0,10/5/2016,95339144,Nathan,"Was great staying at the apartment, was only 10 minutes into dam square so the location was ideal. <br/><br/>The bathroom was a little small and there was a problem with one of the windows. We also found that there wasn't much lighting in the room. This aside, the room and bathroom were very clean with all the essentials provided, and the bed was comfortable.<br/><br/>Alex was away during our stay so we checked-in with Conor who was very friendly and more than willing to help and answer any questions we had. <br/><br/>We would certainly stay here again on our next trip to Amsterdam.<br/><br/><br/>"
20168,108465506.0,10/16/2016,2143937,Eldar,"Alex was very welcoming, gave instructions how to get to the place, met me at the door and was generally very friendly. I never had any issues during my one week of stay. The studio is situated in a very convenient location and right next to it is a very vibrant area with bars, restaurants and such. Other places are also very accessible. I would recommend staying there. Would recommend staying there."
20168,109101247.0,10/19/2016,11421758,Jenny,He allowed us to check in an hour earlier which was awesome ! The neighbourhood was great ! Close to everything ! Apartment was clean and perfect for 2 people ! I would definitely recommend to stay here !
20168,109701581.0,10/23/2016,63977631,Avril,"I felt like we were lucky to stay in such a central location! We walked out the door, turned right, and just a block away were plenty of restaurants, bars, and shopping. The apartment is practically around the corner from Rembrandt Square! <br/>The only thing that put a damper on the trip was when I communicated that our train had been delayed and would get in at 7:30 instead of 4:30, still within the original 2-10pm check-in guidelines. Alex's immediate response was that we were pretty much SOL because he would not be home and there was no way for us to get the keys to our room. Eventually he was able to get a friend to wait for our arrival in order to let us in, show us our room and explain all the rules. However, he charged us extra money for the inconvenience.  It took a lot of back-and-forth texting to get to that point. I was stressing out.  I think that it would be nice if he had a contingency plan in case of delays that are out of the guests' control.<br/>Once we got settled everything was fine. The room is more spacious than I expected, the bed is comfortable, and we were glad to have a TV. The bathroom is a little small but has good water pressure.  It was like a hotel room with no access to other areas of the house, and that was fine with us. I would recommend staying there and being careful to make sure your arrival time is accurate. You might want to give yourself a little cushion to account for arriving, not just the time your flight or train gets in, because he won't wait around for long and might try to charge you for making a change.  But again, the location is just perfect for walking out the front door and getting to explore the center of the city by walking or biking.  Have fun!"
20168,110252787.0,10/25/2016,27994142,Juliette,The studio's location in the center of Amsterdam is absolutely perfect to visit the city and the room is very nice and clean. We spent a great weekend there.

The bathroom is small but has everything we needed and there was even shampoo and body wash although we had brought our own. It was also nice and warm even though it was freezing cold outside which was good. Only negative was the host was slightly abrupt over messaging after a very small misunderstanding prior to arrival which made us a bit apprehensive about arrival but we were met by Connor who was lovely and had no further issues!

Within walking distance of everything in Amsterdam! Bed was comfortable, good showerhead and good tv! Just make sure to check if the windows are actually closed during the winter since there is a counter-intuitive vent on top of the windows. It got left open and it took us a while to figure out why the room was so cold despite the heater being on high--not fun in November--but once we figured it out the room got nice and cozy!"
20168,120276248.0,12/9/2016,99431047,Madeleine,"We enjoyed our stay, Alex's place is not on the a canal but is great walking distance from lots of great sites in Amsterdam. Perfectly clean, and had the advantage of a fridge as well."
20168,120871044.0,12/12/2016,1305659,Anna,"Alex made us feel very welcome and answered all our questions and offered to help with anything if we needed assistance.<br/>The location was perfect for discovering Amsterdam on foot. We were close to all kinds of shops and museums etc. The tram stop was immediately outside the door and came by very frequently. We didn't need to use it except on our arrival and departure. About 10 minutes or less from Central Station.<br/>This is a very old house , as described by Alex, so don't let the steep stairs and worn walls of the entrance hall put you off: the room is as shown in the pictures and is quite roomy and comfortable. Lots of heat and hot water provided. The wi-fi was excellent. Though on a busy street it was surprisingly quiet at night and in the mornings. We had a very comfortable sleep in a very comfy bed! We found the fridge a very good asset to us.I could find no fault with the apartment except I would like at least one bright light for reading our travel guide.<br/>As others have said in reviews the high toilet is a little inconvenient but you get used to it. And when you love the convenience of the location and all the other assets outlined above, it doesn't really matter!<br/>Before we travelled to Amsterdam I asked Alex would he consider supplying a kettle and two cups but he graciously declined!It would have been so convenient! But there are numerous cafes round about.<br/>Alex didn't bother us during our stay and was easy when it came to our departure. I would recommend this apartment for a short stay in fabulous Amsterdam and it would be our dream to return and hopefully Alex will host us again!<br/><br/><br/>"

20168,122535145.0,12/24/2016,30530837,Gavin,"Cosy, clean and romantic room in the heart of Amsterdam city center. A 15 to 20min walk from Amsterdam Central station or just 10min by tram that literally stops in front of the airbnb. 5min from Rembrandt square where there are a dozen of restaurants. Extremely comfortable if you want to spend time in the city center. The house is old and the room is on the 2nd floor. You have to go up a narrow stairs, so it is preferable to come here if you travel light. Bed is great and the area is relatively quiet. The bathroom is cold during the winter and kinda small, but nothing to complain about. The host Alex was friendly and to the point. Discuss with him  regarding the key for when you have to check out."
20168,123027078.0,12/27/2016,69291872,Kate,Amazing apartment so close to everything in Amsterdam! Nice and clean. Quiet at night. It was just a room which we knew but sometimes it is nice just to have a kettle. Out of our control our plans changed and Alex was very up set about this which made us feel very uncomfortable initially. Lovely stay.

We arrived earlier than expected and were greeted by Alex who was very friendly and welcoming. He left us the keys, recommended a place to start our evening and was on his way 5 minutes later to leave us to get on with our trip. The room was clean, warm and the bed very comfortable. Shower had very good water pressure and easy to use. Location was perfect and we were able to walk easily to everywhere we wanted to go. Me and my girlfriend agreed we would definitely stay there again if we ever go back to Amsterdam. Highly recommend to couples looking to stay in the city."

The place is about 4 tram stops from Centraal station. You can take Tram no.16 which stops right in front of the place. Very easy to find the place. Walking distance to the flower market, dam square and Royal Palace. Enjoyed our stay and hopefully can stay there again in the future."
20168,132175237.0,2/16/2017,39941388,Mariah,"This private room was as expected. You have to go up a bit of steps to get to the studio, which wasn't a big deal at all, but just a warning if you have a hard time going up stairs or have super heavy luggage. The location is good, pretty close to museums, and to central Amsterdam. I've never experienced an Airbnb that charges for early/late checkout after set times, and that also will charge for baggage hold even after all Airbnb fees are paid. Wasn't too stoked on that as most Airbnb hosts will let you check in early for free and will hold your bags for free as well if possible, but this is noted in the description. So nothing to really complain about. Good location, clean room and clean and private bathroom- but small. We had a nice stay and host was very nice. "

We had a great flat that overlooks the Main Street giving us a great view of the busy city below.  Our private bathroom was clean and efficient. The mini refrigerator was nice and gave us a spot to keep some snacks cold. We felt completely safe and secure our entire stay.  The central location gave us quick access to all of the sights and public transportation that takes you anywhere you want to go quickly.  We found great pubs and restaurants and even a fresh food market within walking distance of our home away from home.  Rembrandt square is just around the corner. Our host was great and did a great job communicating with us before our stay and was completely accessible to us if we needed him during our visit.  This is a nice home base to visit Amsterdam!

20168,158556499.0,6/7/2017,99909771,Tobias,"Nice, cozy, small and clean apartment placed in the heart of Amsterdam. You can reach the City Centre and everything else within some minutes of walking. However, the price per night seems a little unjustified regarding the size of the apartment. In addition to that, the walls are wafer-thin, hence it is an old house. The house is situated next to a main street which might be very noisy, too. But this depends on the daytime. Nonetheless, the accommodation  is ideal for spending just a couple of nights. Alex, the host, has been very friendly, helpful and answered all our questions. We would recommend this apartment, if you are planning to stay in Amsterdam just for several days."
20168,161206286.0,6/17/2017,90453950,Lingjun,"The room is very comfortable and private. Me and my mother are glad to stay in Alex's place, because he is so nice and willing to help us cope with issues. <br/><br/>It's good to live in central place, which means you can walk to any tourist attractions conveniently. Actually, Alex place just locates in the central line of Amsterdam, between the central station and Amsterdam national museum. <br/>"

The room might be smaller than what you expect from looking at the pictures but it was plenty for what we needed. The only suggestion I have is to furnish the room with a full length mirror l or place the wall mirror lower. Some of us travelers are shorter than the native Dutch ;)
20168,166618423.0,7/4/2017,14435230,Chelsea,"The stay here was great. Me and my boyfriend have visited Amsterdam a number of times but this was our first airbnb. Please remember to bring your own towels and loo paper if you're staying for a while, these weren't replaced or replenished. Apart from that, everything was as expected. The location is great so it can be a bit busy at night. The downside to this was there was a man who claimed he knew Alexander and tried to enter our Room every night. Clearly intoxicated but luckily my boyfriend knows jujitsu and was able to fight him off night after night. <br/><br/>Apart from that, 5 stars Alex. Great stay"

I love the boat, the river view and cats:) Besides, both of us are amazed by Els' life and attracted by the life style! We hope to go again in our next European trip!"
528022,116948794.0,12/4/2016,31029667,Annabelle,"A very special place in the heart of Amsterdam, within walking distance of the centre and the beautiful Jordaan area.  Being on the boat was just perfect, so cosy, warm and secluded. Els was a lovely host with so much enthusiasm for this way of life that we almost wanted to sell up and take to living on the water!"
20168,169867698.0,7/14/2017,326327,Juve,Very central location. Alex was easy to communicate with. Getting from the airport to the studio was a bit of a challenge and a walk especially if you have luggage. The stairs are super narrow which is challenging when carrying luggage. Very central location and close to all the fun and beauty of Amsterdam but the room was quiet and very comfortable. Wifi was a bit spotty but I would stay here again. Thank you Alex!
20168,175995420.0,7/30/2017,27530459,Victoria,"This flat is in easy walking distance of the city's main attractions. There were lots of great restaurants / bars very close by. The room was well presented and clean, although it is situated on a busy road. We slept well with the windows shut as it blocked out the noise, but might not be so ideal for someone looking for a peaceful, tranquil location."
20168,179308229.0,8/7/2017,97361161,Scott,Great place to stay in a central location. Alex was great at communicating and setting up a check in time.

20168,182694090.0,8/15/2017,53125134,Victoria,Great location. Alex was prompt at the agreed upon check in time and the room was bigger than expected and very clean.

20168,200113737.0,10/4/2017,147226181,Chrys,Perfect location. City center is very close to Alex's place. It's like a hotel room.

20168,210428021.0,11/9/2017,153769759,Jean,"Alex's place is in a great location, close to many sights such as Rembrandt Square. There is also a tram stop really close by. Very convenient for exploring other areas of the city.  The building itself is quite old. You'll need to climb two flights of stairs to get to the room, which is a little dark. I would suggest putting brighter lights, as it makes for easier packing and unpacking. The wifi signal was weak and spotty at times, so it's not great if you are heavily reliant on wifi. The building is made of wood and quite old, so sometimes you can hear feel vibrations when neighbours slam their doors (so make sure you don't slam yours). Unfortunately, that's just part of staying in an old wooden apartment. The bathroom is a bit tight, and you will be instructed to leave the little window open, as there are no ventilators installed. As there's no heater in the bathroom, the bathroom will be very cold, if the weather is cold. Get ready to sit on a cold toilet seat, which also happens to be unusually high. Fortunately the shower doors help to keep the heat in while showering. If you stay here, watch out for the knobs that stick out of the bed rails. We jammed our hips into it several times, as the space between the bed and the wall and windows is quite narrow, and the room is dark. Also, there is no hot water boiler/electric kettle in the room (due to an incident with a previous guest, we were told), so you won't be able to make coffee or tea. Fortunately there are some really nice cafes and bakeries (go to <br/> C'est Magnifique at Leidsestraat 18) below and nearby. If not for the above-mentioned points, I would rate this room 5 stars, as the location is really good."
20168,212150092.0,11/16/2017,106158998,Jessica,"¡Hola!<br/>Si buscas una cama cómoda y además que el apartamento este bien ubicado, sin duda te recomiendo hospedarte aquí. Alex te entrega ls llaves de tu habitación y del edificio por lo que tus entradas y salidas son independientes, a demás de que fue puntual en hacerlo. En lo personal la habitación me encanto, no te llevas descripción alguna si lo comparas con la imagen."
20168,216514590.0,12/4/2017,57723283,John,"About a week before we were due to arrive in Amsterdam we received three or four messages from the host concerning our check-in time. We had received others before this, however they appeared as automatic messages, and did not respond(This was our mistake, of course). A few on this occasion appeared to be automatic messages, however there were a few more after which were quite panicked and regarded our expected check-in time. Alex said that he had planned a trip to Germany and that he wouldn't be able to check us in and that we would have to pay a 25€ service charge for somebody else to wait and check us in. It was still a week before we were due to arrive, and we did not feel we needed to provide a check-in time this soon. While it is not Alex's fault that we did not respond to his messages initially, we found his responses quite blunt, and had a lot of emphasis on how the situation ""was not his fault"". At no point did we blame him for the situation, and we paid the charge for our check-in, which was within the times provided on his page, as he had to get somebody to wait for us.<br/><br/>The accomodation and ammenities were all up to standard, and it appears from his reviews that Alex is a nice guy and a thoughtful host. Perhaps we caught him at a bad time, but we felt his communication with us was quite rude and unnecessarily panicked. <br/><br/>Thank you for providing us with your home Alex."
20168,217698020.0,12/10/2017,9483238,Renata,Really perfect place in city centre. Clean and nice room but a little cold. Alex was kind and helpful. We recommend this place.
20168,218695630.0,12/14/2017,152720104,Emily,"Perfect simple space to be able to come back to after exploring the city all day. It is easy to walk to most parts of the city from here but is also in a quiet are so got a great night sleep (in an extremely comfy bed!). Also a good value for money for 2 poor students, so was able to leave us with some more cash to explore the city. Alex was a fantastic host. Would highly recommend."
20168,218846369.0,12/15/2017,4996480,J.P.,"Alex’s apartment was in a great location and is highly walkable, however our stay was not ideal. In a role where customer service and cultural competency matter a great deal, my wife and I found Alex to be demanding (he changed our check-in time without discussion or appreciation) and rude (I understand the Dutch can be direct in their communication, however the first thing Alex did was insult and offend us). As someone who deeply values the human interaction element of Airbnb, and with so many options in Amsterdam, I would not stay here again."
528022,121593824.0,12/18/2016,14709021,Rachael,"One of our favourite ever stays! Els welcomed us warmly to her boat which was the perfect base from which to explore the city.

We were able to come and go as we needed and didn't feel like we were imposing. It was a lovely stay right in the middle of what I assumed would be a very busy time of year. Christmas in Amsterdam is just beautiful."

It is a short walk to any of the local tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.  The room was clean although quite small and simple but that was perfect for us who were not planning on staying in the room for very long other than sleeping and washing.  Only draw back was only one window opened slightly which made the room a bit stuffy at night. All in all a good stay though. Definetily recommend for those wanting to stay in a central location."

O lugar é super aconchegante, cama grande e muito confortável. Chegamos em Amsterdam numa noite fria e confesso que achamos difícil para encontrar o lugar, pois o GPS não conseguia identificar a rua. Ligamos para Els e ela foi muito simpática e explicou em detalhes como chegar. No dia seguinte, tivemos a bela surpresa de acordar com a vista maravilhosa da região. A localização é muito boa e fica a 5 minutos de caminhada da estação central. O único detalhe que me surpreendeu foi o tamanho do banheiro. Compacto e com sistema hidráulico diferente de um banheiro comum pois, obviamente, em uma casa barco não teria como ser igual. Nada que atrapalhasse nossa viagem e nem diminuísse nossa satisfação com o lugar. Lugar perfeito para casais que vão conhecer a cidade e, ao mesmo tempo, querem descansar em um lugar diferente do usual! "

785432,167798759.0,7/8/2017,3738871,Ashley,The fantastic ratings on Daan's houseboat are well-deserved. It's a wondeful place to take in Amsterdam. We stayed for a week and loved sitting on the rooftop deck and watching the boats on the canal. 
785432,169043513.0,7/11/2017,22076898,Alistair,Our 11 year old loved staying on a houseboat - the only problem was getting him to leave! <br/><br/>Despite being in the centre of Amsterdam and across the canal from bars and restaurants - it was surprisingly quiet - even on Saturday night. We loved the outdoor rooftop deck. Will never forget sitting there with a beer watching all the locals and tourists cruise by in their boats. <br/><br/>Daan was easy to deal with and relaxed. He only lives two doors down and popped in to see us a couple of times - which was great. We really appreciated that he looked after our bags after checkout so we could enjoy another few hours in Amsterdam.
785432,170216539.0,7/15/2017,47505475,Patty,"This is an amazing stay and would love to come back again. The boat was in a prime location. Sitting on the deck, taking in the views phenomenal.  Only deduction is a little musty (It is on water so a little to be expected) and some ants ( didn't leave food or dishes which resolved issue). All in all, great place!"
785432,171382731.0,7/17/2017,65083251,Rebekah,"We loved this houseboat!!! It was our first time in Amsterdam and being right on the canal/Amstel River could not have been better! Having the terrace on the deck with chairs/table overlooking the river was incredible. Could not have imagined a better way to experience the canals, right in the middle of it without having to take a canal tour. We had a couple drinks up there and waved to the boats going by -- a lot of fun. We were a little nervous about what the houseboat would be like, but it was very close to the photos and was just perfect for our group of 4. I think it could be tight with a group larger than 4 for sleeping purposes since it was just the one bedroom with a queen size bed and another bedroom with 2 small twin beds. The living room has an L-shaped couch but I'm not sure that it was a pull out, so I think 4 would be the max amount of people. However, it was still quite spacious and clean, with nice working facilities (we were nervous the bathroom facilities wouldn't be full-sized or work well but they were just like a regular apartment). I was really surprised by how big the living/kitchen area felt. Daan and Monica were both very accommodating and we were able to leave our bags at Daan's boat (just a couple boats down) on our last day, which allowed us to continue exploring the city since our flight wasn't until that evening. That was a big plus for us because the one thing you don't always get with AirBNB vs a hotel is somewhere to check your bags, so that was very good for us. A great experience and I think it made Amsterdam the highlight of our trip to Europe! Highly recommend!"
785432,171697994.0,7/18/2017,6799398,Jessie,Daan took great care of us -- great location and wonderful way to do Amsterdam. Only wish we could have had more sunsets on the canal.

On est tout près de la gare.La terrasse est merveilleuse et plonge le voyageur au cœur de qui semble être la vie d'Amsterdam,avec une petite réserve, le passage occasionnel de barques remplies de fetards diffusant de la musique à fort volume la nuit. Les lits sont excellents, la salle de bain pratique et si on aime cuisiner, la cuisine (Website hidden by Airbnb) d' un four et d'une bonne table de cuisson, très agréable pour prendre des repas faits maison sur la terrasse ou perchés sur les tabourets du séjour , on ne perd jamais de vue la rivière et c'est  magique."
785432,175247698.0,7/28/2017,1512623,Nick,The houseboat was better than we could've imagined. We spent so much time watching other boats go by from the roof top deck. Daan's houseboat is in the perfect location and Daan offered many great recommendations for us.
785432,175862075.0,7/30/2017,38147465,Tore,Det er et fantastisk sted. Båten er meget romslig og det var en fornøyelse og sitte på dekk og se alle kanalbåtene seile forbi. Det er gå avstand til absolutt alt. Det var meget rent og pent. Vil bare takke Daan og Monica for et fantastisk flott opphol og jeg anbefaler dette videre med glede. I tillegg til alt dette fikk jeg avtalt med Daan tidlig innsjekk og sen utsjekk siden vi hadde tidlig og sent fly inn/Ut av Amsterdam. Helt topp

It was perfectly located in the center, in an area that was close to a few restaurants/cafes but also close to the tourist spots we'd want to hit (which we didn't spend too much time at). We couldn't help but spend a few hours on the comfortable deck with a fantastic view of the canal and buildings. The inside of the boat was clean and had lots of windows. We could have stayed much longer as it felt like a flat and not a boat! Daan himself was extremely helpful and communicative. We were also able to secure a taxi very early in the morning. If in doubt, just book this wonderful houseboat! You won't regret it. "

Lovely comfy bed and blackout curtains which helped block out some of the noise from the road (which wasn't particularly loud even when the curtains were open) Would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Amsterdam.
20168,344757041.0,11/4/2018,37506766,Lavinia,"I had a very nice trip to Amsterdam. The room was clean and like in the pictures. Those big windows in the morning are an amazing boost for the day. The house is very well placed. You are basically near everything you have to visit in Amsterdam. We didn't used any tram, we walked and it was very cool. I recommend this place and if I will come back I guess I will come back to Alexander."
20168,345546131.0,11/5/2018,24531900,Alex,I had a nice stay here. The location was good and the place was super clean. I’d stay here again.
528022,130515415.0,2/6/2017,11043453,Patrick,"Hébergement original dans une petite péniche au bout d'un quai à 15mn à pied (d'un bon pas) de la vie citadine où à quelques mètres d'un arrêt de bus (le 48, toutes les 20mn). Lieu très calme propre à une certaine méditation. Intéressant comme concept, ne serait ce que dans l'observation d'un mode de vie alternatif partagé par d'autres Amesteldamois. La cabine est traitée avec bon goût et simplicité dans des tons reposants. Malheureusement, la cuvelle des WC combinée à la douche isolée dans la cabine (la chambre) par un simple pare douche en pastique branlant , si elle est peut être ""authentique"" n'en est pas moins ""tue l'amour"". <br/>En ce sens, le prix réclamé me semble excessif. Dommage.<br/>Else a été discrète, est sans doute aurait elle été efficace si nous avions fait appel à elle."
528022,131173796.0,2/11/2017,112757799,Charles,"A truly lovely place to stay, we stayed for three nights during January and thoroughly enjoyed staying on the 'Cornelia'. The boat is a great place to stay and is incredibly warm, even in the depths of winter. We found the view from the Captain's cabin excellent and was a great place to sit and reflect. <br/><br/>We will never forget our trip to Amsterdam when we stayed on the 'Cornelia'. Many thanks to Els for being a wonderful host. "
528022,132027370.0,2/15/2017,111881679,Franziska,"Bei Els ist es (Website hidden by Airbnb) ist klein, niedlich und ein sehr ruhiger, erdender und zum Entspannen einladender Ort, an dem man das Wasser genießen und die Seele baumeln lassen kann...."
20168,346113600.0,11/7/2018,3450231,Xenia,"The stay at Alex' apartment has been very nice. The flat is very well located and you walk to the centre in under 5-10 minutes. The bed is insanely comfortable. Just the bathroom is a little tiny, but that was no big issue. <br/>We can recommend the place very much if you want to stay for a short trip :)"
20168,347920136.0,11/12/2018,218812712,Antoni,Très agréable et super emplacement. <br/>Je le recommande fortement.
20168,351914553.0,11/24/2018,195378607,Yamila,"Me hospede en el piso de Alex. <br/>Es muy hermoso y la ubicación es buena, pero lo que realmente me hizo pasar mal y dudar en el momento de si perder mi dinero e irme a un hotel o quedarme allí fue el trato con Alex. Desde el momento 1 fue bastante rudo con los mensajes solo porque yo estaba trabajando y no los podía leer. Le expliqué y ya me había molestado bastante su forma de hablarme. <br/>Luego tuve otro problema cuando llegue a amsterdam, habíamos arreglado que me iría a buscar y me llevaría a la casa. Llegue y Alex esperaba que yo pudiera llegar sola a una terminal de salidas siendo que iba por primera vez a amsterdam, no tengo porque conocer el aeropuerto y además algo obvio. LLEGAMOS EN ARRIBOS Y SALIDAS ESTA AL OTRO LADO DEL AEROPUERTO. la comunicación fue malísima y el no nos habló nada bien. Es bastante grosero. Realmente me saco de quicio la situación y me tomé un uber porque era muy complicado. <br/>La casa es hermosa, pero no se si vale la pena, el trato es muy importante y es la primera impresión."
20168,353272872.0,11/27/2018,168761978,Perry,Overall decent
20168,353942448.0,11/30/2018,42302394,Thalia,"Alex's room is in a great location and is really good value for money (if you don't check in early/late)! <br/><br/><br/>The room had all the basics and was in such a fantastic location, especially given the reasonable price. The bed was comfortable and we had all the basics we needed. We only stayed for one night and it was perfect for us for one night. If you wanted to stay longer, it may be worth noting that the bathroom is pretty small and there are no tea making facilities/only plastic cups for drinking water from the bathroom tap. <br/><br/>My main negative was that, as soon as we booked, we received an email with a list of extra costs for early/late check in (€25/35!), baggage storage etc. and it came across incredibly unfriendly and gave me the impression that the host was going to try to find any excuse to charge me extra. But everything was fine and we didn't pay anything extra. <br/><br/>Overall, the room was perfect for us for a one night stay and really good value. Thanks!"
20168,355722087.0,12/5/2018,63541458,Devan,Great apartment in a central location. We were able to walk everywhere and everything was in a 10-15 minute radius. Small apartment but cute and worth it for your trip to Amsterdam.
20168,355877198.0,12/6/2018,51983517,Anna,Alex was very prompt with our check in and check out! Everything was clean and in order. Great location for seeing the city!

20168,357904868.0,12/12/2018,56035492,Fernando,"I wouldn't stay here again unless there was literally no other option, or that I didn't have enough time to book elsewhere.<br/><br/>The apartment is VERY NICELY located, with a Grocery store less than 5 minutes away.. and a very comfortable bed. That's all the good things I have to mention.<br/><br/>Wi-Fi did not work ANY of the days we stayed there, not even the ""other"" networks they recommended us to connect to, in practicality we were OFFLINE while here.<br/><br/>The apartment building is more like a poorly renovated area, with a poorly built, MINUSCULE staircase, no elevator (which we knew), and literally dirty, messed up drywall that hasn't been cleaned since construction.<br/><br/>This is nothing more than a bed in a room with a door.. there's no love in this apartment, there's nothing worth writing about in it, it's literally barebones minimalism, in a good location."

528022,132672920.0,2/19/2017,109219017,Keith,A beautiful boat tucked out of the way but yet within walking distance of central Amsterdam. We loved the views over the water and the quietness of the location.  Els was a great host being flexible with arrival and departure times. We would definitely stay again next time we are visiting Amsterdam. 
528022,134414524.0,2/27/2017,43993301,Frederik,"Nice and quite, beautiful boat and bedroom, in a good location (15-20 minutes walk to central station)"
528022,135259754.0,3/4/2017,23564749,Adrianne,"A fantastic boat in a beautiful setting within walking distance from all the action of Amsterdam. An easy transfer from the airport by either train, bus or taxi (I don't recommend taxi as very expensive) and Els was so helpful and approachable. "
20168,368123312.0,1/6/2019,22096128,Flash,"Alexander had a nice room in an amazing location to sight see. It was a little noisy at night, as you can hear every movement of the person staying above you. Also we couldn’t get the tv and the internet to work. We weren’t in the room much though, so that wasn’t a major issue for us. The bed was comfortable, and the room was nice overall. We would stay again."
20168,368876324.0,1/8/2019,61575769,Vanessa,"Alexander’s place was perfect for our stay in Amsterdam. Not only was the room very clean and conveniently located, but when issues arose, Alexander helped us to find a solution quickly and efficiently. Thanks again for a wonderful stay!"

20168,418519744.0,3/2/2019,176954022,Pono,We had a nice stay at Alexander’s studio.  Studio was clean and in a prime location. Just a few notes before booking. The steps leading to the studio are very steep<br/>And tight. The studio is a lot smaller than I anticipated but good enough for me and my girlfriend. The bathroom also is very small and toilet is high off the ground.
20168,419902017.0,3/5/2019,60112309,Kelsey,Great location and great host.
20168,421321034.0,3/9/2019,1979076,Kellene,The location was great! In a nice part of town that seemed pretty easy to find everything. The area is pretty quiet at night and the neighborhood seemed safe. there's a coffee shop below that has great croissants. The wifi access was a little poor and we struggled with that. Overall a great experience.
20168,422490117.0,3/11/2019,216212563,Josh,"Lovely modern room in an ideal location, within walking distance of all the attractions. Perfect for couples"
20168,423169117.0,3/13/2019,92730436,Brian,"This place has an amazing location. Walking distance from every where you would want to visit in Amsterdam. Very basic, small studio apartment.   Poor WiFi signal, be prepared to use cell if necessary.  Also TV reception was bad so if you hang out there at all, make sure you have some sort of entertainment.  The host tries to hit you up to pay extra for amenities but just say no. Toilet is oddly high off the ground, and if you visit during the winter the bathroom will be cold."
20168,424758048.0,3/17/2019,72779786,Lars Alexander,All was as described. Would recommend for anyone who just needs a private room with own entrance and the best location in Amsterdam
20168,425909311.0,3/19/2019,54970592,Ahmed,"The room is placed nicely in the centre of Amsterdam within walking distance from a lot of place but even better, a tram goes right outside.

Il y a un café juste en bas de la porte d’entrée dans lequel nous avons pris tous nos petits déjeuners et cafés ils sont très bien! Alexander a été un hôte très réactif, disponible et de bons conseils! Je recommande cet endroit qui est parfait pour passer quelques jours à Amsterdam car nous pouvons tout faire à pied (et le tram est juste en face de l’appartement)."

Alexander was so kind and helpful, let us check in early, provided a 24 hour number to contact him if we had any trouble and provided us with everything we needed.

20168,477005457.0,6/27/2019,94844595,María Gabriel,"The location is beyond amazing, you are near the center of the city and  affordable restaurants are close. The space is comfortable and it has a really nice style."
20168,478568948.0,6/30/2019,115364567,Renata,"O quarto é muito bom, espaçoso , bem localizado, limpo. Fizemos muitos programas a pé.  O banheiro é pequenininho mas não atrapalhou em nada. Em baixo do prédio tem um coffe que serve cafe da manha que eh bem gostoso. Alexander era muito rápido nas respostas, nos permitiu fazer late check in por um valor a mais e tb nos deixou deixar as malas la por 1 hora a mais do check in sem cobrar nada. Para chegar no quarto tem umas escadas e quem tiver mala pesada se prepare seria único incomodo, mas que não atrapalhou, pois Alexander prontamente nos ajudou."
20168,479682550.0,7/1/2019,950813,Julie,"We had a short 1 night stay at Alexander's, the location was great for us. He was there to greet us upon arrival which was easy as he responded to messages fast. The place is clean, small shower but a really good pressure and temperature, and yes a high toilet but thoughtful to have a stool for easy access and to view the mirror. The room was warm at night because we had to close the windows (to block the sound outside) but there's a fan for ventilation. Overall a nice place with a convenient location. Recommended if you need a short stay in Amsterdam!"
528022,135546708.0,3/5/2017,58085041,Vincent,We spent a great weekend on Els' wonderful boat. Els is very welcoming and the area is really peaceful and beatiful.
528022,137945396.0,3/18/2017,22853755,Samantha,A place where you need to go if you wanna feel like you're somewhere else in Amsterdam :D <br/>Everything was brilliant!
528022,138149172.0,3/19/2017,89516304,Edward,"Als je Amsterdam in zijn volledigheid wil ervaren, dan is een overnachting op het water echt een topper. Hartstikke gezellig en een ideale plek om herinneringen te maken!"

So close to absolutely everything but still quiet enough that you get a good nights sleep. Check in and out was really easy. The place is perfect if you just want a ‘stop and go’, we never need a kitchen because of all the amazing places to eat nearby. WiFi was super quick and the room was lovely and clean. Thanks again, will be back!"
20168,489670950.0,7/17/2019,34698270,Miya,"The apartment is in a safe location. Extremely close to all of the attractions around Amsterdam. If you’re a walker there’s not need for public transportation! We walked the entire city and it was fine. The house is under minor renovation in the hallways. The room is perfect for 2-4 days. There is a refrigerator, desk, and bed. The room is bigger than I expected and the bathroom is clean. Just a stand up shower, toilet, and sink. Check in easy, make sure to just press the doorbell."

20168,495542891.0,7/26/2019,36656352,Mateuse,Alexander's place was in an absolutely fantastic location in Amsterdam! All big sights and main walking tours were within walking distance and it was close to central station.  It was located in a nice area and all facilities were as described. We were in Amsterdam during 37 degree Celsius heat so it did get a bit hot (no airconditioning). However this temperature was very out of the ordinary and we were provided with a fan for air circulation.
20168,508037916.0,8/12/2019,249009550,David,We had a great stay at Alexander's place. It was very clean and in a perfect location. Literally 12 minute walk to all the main attractions. Couldn't fault anything and we will definitely be back.
20168,509300331.0,8/14/2019,39925880,Chris,"My partner and I had a SUPER stay at Alexander’s studio flat. It has all you need, is spotlessly clean and is a great location, being on Tram route 24 direct to the Central Train Station and being close to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. There is a bagel shop underneath the flat, so breakfast/brunch is easy!<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/>We did.<br/>Chris and Helen"
20168,512206124.0,8/18/2019,197491051,Friedrich Alexander,Nice and cozy appartment. The only negative thing was that the walls are very thin. Next to the appatment was a construction site and it felt like they were working in our room. However the adresse of the flat is very good and every major sight was in walking distance.

It’s in the perfect location, an equally short walk from both the museums and the city centre, with plenty of cafes nearby. The space itself is small, but comfortable, private, clean and has everything you’ll need for a short stay. Check-in and check-out were incredibly convenient, and we were even able to check-in early. Overall, we highly rate our stay here, the only recommendation I can make is to have some amenities in the room to make tea and coffee."

It was located within walking distance of everything we needed, right next to the canals and a short walk to the station. The room it’s self was spacious and the bed was so comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side but perfect for what we needed for a few nights. I would definitely recommend staying here. Alexander is very flexible and allowed us to check in late as our flight was a late one."

Also, the bed was so comfortable I did not want to leave :) Overall, a fabulous find for me as a single student. <br/><br/>Two things to be aware of: first, there are a number of stairs, and secondly, the space is maintained as a quiet, drug-free residence. Always good to be aware of compatibility before you book, but if those aren't issues for you, it really is just about the perfect place."

Not a place to spend much daytime in. You may need to use the stool to climb onto the lavatory! But the bed is comfortable, and all is very clean. The stairs are steep, as you will know. The host will meet you as arranged. He is not effusive! His instructions are helpful but given at machine-gun speed."

20168,621107727.0,3/28/2020,64507811,Stefan,"Don't be fooled by the other reviews here - This host has been passive aggressive since the first point of contact, making completely inappropriate remarks and insults to his <br/>guests. He was shouting and screaming because it took me 24 hours to gather all necessary check in information, even though it was a last minute booking... Unreal, and something I've never experienced on Airbnb. Would have cancelled straight away, were it not for the very limited availability (and lack of refund options). <br/><br/>All in all this host gave us a very awful aftertaste to our whole Airbnb experience (let alone our stay in Amsterdam). Avoid at all cost! "

528022,143982413.0,4/14/2017,118806249,Paco,Els's houseboat is a very quiet and peaceful place. It's located around 15/20 mn walking from the Amsterdam Centraal train station so it's quite close to the touristic aerea too. Els is a very sympathic but also discreet host. She helps you whenever you need it. The place is not so big but it's clean and very cosy. I will certainly go there the day I travel back to Amsterdam !!!

Our host was particularly charming as is the pier with other houseboats and children. The kids were swimming off the boat when we arrived; it was tempting to join them. We walked to and from the central train station but busses and trams are easy to use. Steve in Portland"

It was great to wake up on the water every morning and to be gently rocked to sleep each night.  What better place to stay in Amsterdam than a boat!  Amsterdam is a great city, but staying at Els's place made it fantastic!"
528022,160681725.0,6/15/2017,114396286,Hayley,Beautiful get away. Great option of you would like to be a little private but still in close proximity to shops
27886,2359368.0,9/21/2012,128124,Chuck,"What can I say, Flip provided the perfect Amsterdam experience for us and did so on a beautiful boat. It's located on the water near the city center. He provides bikes and a canoe (although we didn't have a chance to use that). <br/><br/>Breakfast is left each morning in your cabin and is the nicest European breakfast I've had to date. Wonderful breads, meats, cheese and jams. <br/><br/>The space is surrounded by water and is in a very safe neighborhood. We walked all over the city quite easily. <br/><br/>I can't thank Flip enough for being the perfect host. Thanks for making our trip so wonderful!"
528022,161457101.0,6/18/2017,100305764,Svenja,"We loved the boat, our neighbours and the whole atmosphere of Houthaven. Els made sure that we we had everything we could possibly ask for, helped us out with any questions and lets you have your privacy if that's what you want. We will recommend this place to friends and family, as it's the perfect spot to relax after a day in beautiful Amsterdam! "
528022,164043747.0,6/26/2017,121046991,Lia,Els's place was fabulous! She knew we were coming for our honeymoon and had champagne and a cute flower spread all set up for us!

528022,169045214.0,7/11/2017,14032131,Julie Smilla,"Our stay with Els was great! She was such a nice host and the boat was so cozy and nice. <br/>I would say the location is central, but not in the busiest area. The canals are a short, but nice, walk from this home.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend staying with Els if you are going to Amsterdam - I don't think there is a better way to experience the city than by living on a/her houseboat."

We enjoyed the stay since it was only 2 nights.  A would not recommend it for a longer stay.  Else is very nice and available.  If coming from overseas with no 4G... you may need more detailed instructions to find the boat!

27886,7509410.0,9/23/2013,2580046,Leigh,Just a superb way to spend time in Amsterdam. A very well constructed space within this boat creates a very comfortable environment. Very close to town and central station and a very comfortable bed. Just when you think things can't get any better Flip turns up with a breakfast that wows. Flip is all very helpful and interesting. Highly recommended. The bikes are the icing on the cake. Also Flip has a little hidden gem of a restaurant to point you to.

A lot of variety for a catered breakfast."

Il est prévenant et à l'écoute. Vous ne serez pas déçu du détour.<br/><br/>A prendre sans hésiter !"

The location was just far enough away to get away from the craziness and close enough to enjoy everything AMS has to offer. We would return without a second thought!
27886,34691248.0,6/11/2015,26277787,Kortney,"This was a great houseboat. Location is a bit off the beaten path- in a good way. No tour boats flying by at all hours, peaceful, beautiful. Great breakfast in the morning. Very quaint quarters but my 6'3"" husband didn't mind and said it was well worth it. Bikes included was a huge bonus. Less than 5 minute bike ride to some great restaurants, cafes, and shops. Would recommend to friends! "

Heel rustig, en toch vlakbij het hart van de stad (onze vouwfietsen kwamen goed van pas). <br/>Het is een verrassende locatie, het dobberen en wiegen geeft rust.

528022,242071293.0,3/11/2018,111616030,Johanna,It's a nice small room with a very big bed. You can make yourself some tea and coffee. The shower and the toilet are small but that was no problem.

The houseboat is lovely and cozy. The breakfast that Flip brought us every morning was the cherry on top. He also provided us with bikes, which truly is the best way to see Amsterdam. It was a great experience staying here! The location is great. Quiet but not far from the city centre. Very close to the artsy area of Amsterdam! Definitely recommend staying here. You will not regret it! "

528022,246779125.0,3/26/2018,12364867,Francesca,"La barca di Els è davvero una sistemazione ideale per trascorrere qualche giorno ad Amsterdam. E' fuori dal caotico centro ma a due passi da tutto. Con le biciclette poi, gli spostamenti sono ancora più facili. L'atmosfera sul molo è davvero tranquilla e gli abitanti vicini sono tutte persone estremamente gentili. Els è un'ottima padrona di casa, discreta ma disponibile. La stanza all'interno della barca è pulita, confortevole e munita di tutto il necessario. Inoltre ha un suo accesso privato quindi c'è una totale privacy. E' davvero un'oasi di pace a pochi minuti dal centro. Inoltre, il quartiere vicino è molto carino e fuori dai circuiti più turistici. Un'ottima esperienza da raccomandare a tutti coloro che, soggiornando qualche giorno, vogliono fare un'esperienza più vera della vita di Amsterdam."
528022,248828318.0,4/1/2018,97883335,Jodi,"I booked this trip as a surprise for my parents. Els was a pleasure to coordinate with and very patient when my parents flight got delayed.

On a vu vivre la ville d'Amsterdam d'un point de vue qui n'est pas donné à tout le monde : nous avons été aux premières loges pour voir la vie sur les canaux, en journée avec les bateaux remplis de touristes, mais aussi en soirée avec les petits bareaux privés sur lesquels les amstellodamois se plaisent à boire l'apéro au fil de l'eau !!! :-)<br/>L'accueil de Monica était parfait. La péniche avait tout le confort annoncé sur le site Airbnb. Elle est magnifique tant à l'intérieur qu'a l'extérieur  et super bien située. <br/>Et, cerise sur le gâteau , la petite terrasse sur le pont !!!! <br/>Merci."

The day we arrived, we cancelled all of our plans in order to take advantage of the rooftop deck. The location was perfect, check-in was easy, and the boat had everything we could have needed.  Would love to stay again and would definitely recommend to others who wish to experience a local's view of Amsterdam's canals."
785432,186648387.0,8/25/2017,22530997,Adam,"Daan's house is one of the most unique living experiences in Amsterdam! The house was very clean and as described by the images.

Unsere Erwartungen hat es übertroffen. Danke!"

785432,192005738.0,9/9/2017,133977750,Effie,"We had a great time at the houseboat. It was very comfortable  and the location was perfect. We were about 100feet from the Waterlooplein metro stop(it is the 3rd stop coming out of centraal station) and the #9 tram was across the street.  We didn't know how easy it was to access so we went in the wrong direction! Called Daan who came right over to get us and helped us with bags. So fun to sit on the rooftop deck and watch the traffic on the river Amstel.  Would love to do it again next time we go to Amsterdam. If you have mobility issues it may not be good for you . There is a small door and  a steep stair with tiny steps to get into boat. That problem aside, highly recommend it."
785432,193794917.0,9/15/2017,10719764,Mari-Kay,We've visited Amsterdam several times and the boat was our absolute favorite place to stay. It's so much fun watching all the boats go by and the enjoyed the spectacular views from the roof deck. Lots of restaurants and points if interest close by!

We had four adults staying on the boat and had ample room. Daan went above and beyond-he even coordinated a birthday cake to be there waiting for us upon arrival for my 30th birthday. <br/><br/>His terrace on the roof of the boat offers some of the best afternoon people watching and even better sunsets. This is not to be missed. Thanks again, Daan, for being such a wonderful host."

Die Unterkunft ist genau wie beschrieben, alles sehr sauber und ganz besonders liebevoll eingerichtet-einfach toll! Ein besonderes Highlight ist sicherlich das Frühstück, welches man mit einem herrlichen Blick auf die Gracht genießen kann.

The surrounding area is beautiful, with a city farm and historic craft beer bar within 2 mins walk (try the Oud Kase at Westerdok bar - it comes on a guillotine!) The breakfast provided by Flip was more than enough to make sandwiches for lunch too, and he thoughtfully catered to our dietary needs. Bikes and canoe are provided free which is a huge bonus. We were foolish enough to leave our glasses behind but Flip messaged us before we even realised and will post them back. A fantastic host with a fantastic boat in a stunning location. We cannot recommend this highly enough!"

It was also very quiet and peaceful. The breakfast was outstanding with many choices of food and more than one could eat.  Having bikes available to explore Amsterdam was a big plus.  The boat is in the heart of Amsterdam.  Flip also helped us call a cab to take us to the airport which made catching our flight easy.

27886,73063579.0,5/6/2016,17204815,Vanessa,We had a great stay on the Ms. Luctor. This is probably the best way to stay in Amsterdam. The location is perfect - close to the city center and the train station - but in a quiet and relaxing neighborhood.
27886,73442634.0,5/8/2016,44089664,Alyona,"Amsterdam is a crazy city! With a lot of people and bicycles( besides cars and trams). Full of new experience and freedom of mind. We found our silent and comfortable bay near the city central! Location is good, owner will offer to you bicycles - which you need to use if you are in Amsterdam!:) Flip prepared a brilliant breakfast!  You have to try it by your own- that cost it! It was a pleasure to stay in Flip's boat. Thank you, wish all the best to you and your family! "
27886,76459228.0,5/27/2016,17214239,Andrea Ørnes,"We can't think of a better location to live when in Amsterdam! It's in a quite area just a short walk away from the city centre. The two bikes enable you to explore the whole city. The houseboat is a very unique living experience. It's very cozy, functional and has everything you need. Flip is a caring and easy going host and he serves delicious breakfast everyday. We recommend this place highly. "
27886,77547212.0,6/1/2016,41309513,Emily,"I highly recommend this houseboat to anyone staying in Amsterdam. It is in a great location next to the central station stop. The boat is quiet at night and just across the water were lots of delicious restaurants and a bar or two. The pictures are very accurate and the houseboat was actually much nicer than I was expecting. Lots of hot water, lots of thoughtful amenities (like a little bluetooth speaker) and a super comfy bed! Breakfast was yummy too, I love Dutch cheese <3. I was actually really sad to leave. I could have lived there for a couple months easy no problem. Thank you to our lovely host, Flip, as well. We will be back next time we come to Amsterdam! "

Daan was super friendly, helpful and knowledgable about the area. I highly recommend staying here if you have the opportunity."
785432,201904497.0,10/9/2017,48672267,Susan,An amazing experience!  Daan was very accommodating and welcoming and the boat is a very special way to experience Amsterdam.  We will be back with our children!
785432,202625398.0,10/12/2017,128493581,Jennifer,Would recommend as a great unusual place to stay why stay in a hotel in Amsterdam when you can stay on a boat fab experience.
785432,203526935.0,10/15/2017,125740933,Juan,"Daan Houseboat is really fantastic, it is located in Amsterdam middle-town to 50 meters of metro waterloo station. It is very comfortable and Daan is a great guy, he explained all very detailed and was very hospitality. I will come back, absolutely recommend."
785432,203976014.0,10/16/2017,15610268,Saks,We only stayed for one night but will definately come back again. It'a a unique place to stay in Amsterdam. Quiet and relaxed yet close to the centre and other interesting sights. Daan is very friendly and helpfull. Highly recommended.
785432,204488100.0,10/18/2017,7080408,Phil,"Staying in a houseboat in Amsterdam was a dream come true. It was so nice being directly on the water, setting up a nice spread on the roof deck and watching all the boats go by! Being so central the houseboat is near to groceries, coffeeshops, bars, restaurants and so much culture. Will be aiming to stay at Dana’s houseboat the next time I’m able to get back to Amsterdam for sure!"
785432,204676122.0,10/19/2017,133512227,Henry,It’s right outside the opera house. Close to the centre loads of bars and shops and restaurants for all tases nearby. Not secluded but not a problem if you want to get the full amsterdam experience. <br/><br/>Daan is a great host and the boats just beautiful inside. Rustic and very comfy. <br/><br/>We loved it. Perfect for a short break.
785432,207457693.0,10/29/2017,44752908,Chloe,"Great location, great hospitality, would recommend!"
785432,212559518.0,11/18/2017,140405620,David,"My first stay in a house boat in Amsterdam in about 20 years! and i'm glad to say it exceeded expectations.<br/>Cool place, comfy and warm for the 4 of us.  I think it would be a little cramped for 5 adults.<br/>We had a glorious saturday morning on on the seated area on top of the boat taking in the winter sun.  <br/>Location wise it's all we wanted - 5-10 mins from Dam Square and the red light district, 5 mins from rembrandtplein and 10 mins away from the Tuschinski cinema which if I have time I always try and catch a decent film at when in the city.<br/>The smaller bedroom was the only thing not perfect...we were 4 friends sharing so the room was pretty small and had a partition above your shins with about a 2 foot gap.  In no way did it affect our stay - a definite 5 star review from me.  We'll be rebooking here for sure."
528022,270832711.0,5/30/2018,168465055,Wyatt,"Really great place and it was a very good value. Although the boat is only a 5-10 minute bus ride away from the city center, the dock was quiet and peaceful. There are a few small cafes and bars in the surrounding area and it's only a 20-30 minute walk to the Anne Frank house. I would definitely recommend staying here again."
528022,271444225.0,6/1/2018,9015830,Amanda,"What a wonderful place. Sit in the captain’s area for coffee or sunset snack, jump in the harbor to swim, and stay so close to central station in a  quiet & calm area. I felt so grateful that Els opened her home to us, & if you get the chance to stay here, what a gift. We hope to return. "
27886,79856552.0,6/14/2016,34468582,Jessica,"My stay on the house boat was lovely, definitely one of the most unique Airbnbs I have stayed in.  The arrival process was very smooth as flip communicated with me via email to ensure everything was ready by he time I wanted to check in.  There was water and 2 local brews awaiting upon our arrival and the place was very clean.  We had 2 bikes with locks and a canoe to use at our disposal. The house boat is located very close to everything you will want to see in Amsterdam but is on a quiet canal which was relaxing.  There is a nice patio outside that we were able to drink wine on and watch boats go by on the canal.  The breakfast provided was delicious, fresh bread and croissants, cheese and sausage, eggs, jams and honey, cereal granola milk and yogurt.. More than enough for 2 people.  The bed is the most comfortable bed I slept in during my entire stay in Europe.  Additionally flip provides a book with any recommendations for restaurants and sites to see complete with maps and all.  Would definitely stay here again!"
27886,80304443.0,6/17/2016,14841733,Jayne,"Absolutely fantastic! We loved everything- the super comfy bed, the incredible sunsets, delish breakfasts, Flip is a pro! Would love to stay there again. The location for me was perfect, room to breathe but still in canal district.excellent place for a run as well."
27886,80999287.0,6/20/2016,58893350,Darragh,"We stayed for three nights in total and found Flip to be an excellent host! The houseboat is lovely, and in a great location within walking distance of town but yet quiet at the same time. The breakfast was fantastic, and having the bikes there is great if you fancy a spin around the city and the nearby park. Can't recommend it enough!"
27886,82813382.0,6/29/2016,5976299,Terri,The houseboat was clean and lovely. Flip was friendly and the breakfast was bountiful and delicious. Make sure you lock it carefully at all times. <br/>

Location is perfect, the boat is a dream, breakfast is delicious, the host is super-friendly and the breakfast: wow! You will have a hard time to find anything comparable to this amazing place! "
27886,84417722.0,7/7/2016,52365828,Katrina,AMAZING- from the moment we walked up to the dock it was great. Flip was friendly- gave us really great tips on shopping and food in the area gave us a great tour. best air bnb experience and really made our trip to amsterdam perfect.
27886,86563066.0,7/17/2016,747921,Liette,"This accommodation is a self-contained section of a bigger boat, where Flip lives. So the included breakfast (a very generous one!) comes fresh every morning served at your table. <br/>We've loved the outdoor section (at the end of the pier) with a table setting where we could have a drink at night watching the beautiful canal view and appreciating the calm of this area. You even get the fragrance of a jasmine bush, which is really lovely.<br/>We've used the two bicycles everyday, which allowed us to easily access everything in Amsterdam. You can find everything in less than 5 min. away (cafés, restaurants, bars, grocery, and many very cute shops namely on Haarlemmerdijt/Haarlemmerstraat)<br/>I recommend Flip's boat, as I couldn't imagine a better way to enjoy Amsterdam! "
27886,99396314.0,9/4/2016,12068228,Thien,"When in Amsterdam there is nothing better than staying in a house boat, Flip's boat is within walking distant to central station and the city centre. Having breakfast on the boat every morning was the highlight of our stay. "

Location was great and room was well set up - comfortable large bed - not two twins put together which we experienced in our hotels."

785432,221383629.0,12/26/2017,53111367,Chris,"Daan’s place was a fantastic. We were welcomed by his neighbour who settled us in. The boat had been decorated with Christmas lights and a Christmas tree, which was a really nice touch. Daan popped in the following day to ensure we were ok. It was a good place to explore Amsterdam from and was a comfortable and cosy home for our stay. We’d recommend it to anyone looking for a unique Amsterdam experience."
785432,225061518.0,1/5/2018,82127129,Samantha,My friends and I had the pleasure of staying here in January and had an amazing time. The houseboat was one of the highlights of our time spent in Amsterdam. Even in the winter the houseboat stayed warm and offered amazing views of a beautiful neighborhood. The houseboat lives up to expectations and I would not hesitate in staying here again in the future. 
785432,225726372.0,1/7/2018,4813728,David,"A very charming and clean houseboat with all the modern conveniences provided.  Location is excellent, wonderful views from the deck. Would easily stay here again. An amazing view you couldn't get anywhere else, especially with the night lights of the city.  Noise can get a bit 'loutish' on a Friday and Saturday being opposite the Ice Bar, popular tourist bar. Other than that, excellent!"
785432,226539620.0,1/11/2018,134411311,Karen,"A quintessential houseboat on the Amstel River seemed appropriate for our Amsterdam visit and Daan's home fit the bill. Roomy and easily sleeps four, toasty warm inside despite the often cold and windy January weather. <br/><br/>Daan was a great and responsive host; we got slightly lost looking for the car park (which by the way is a secure, locked garage) and he came right down to take us there. <br/><br/>Plenty of seating, big bathroom, and your own private outdoor deck (with a resident swan that swims right up to greet you:) An amazing experience!"
785432,227567294.0,1/15/2018,69615779,Stephen,"The surprise and the intriguing look in the groups eyes were worth the money alone! <br/><br/>A great stay, even in the bitter cold the boat heats up well, the upper deck is simply beautiful and hours can be spent watching the people boats and wildlife. <br/><br/>Third time in the dam and this location was bar far the best, close to quality restaurants pubs and shops. <br/><br/>Daan was brilliant throughout! Highly recommend!!"

785432,230516961.0,1/28/2018,152946159,Tim,"Daan's houseboat is located opposite to the Opera House, so is very central.  The boat is really well equipped, with nice touches like towels, coffee and tea provided. It even has a terrace where you can sit, enjoy a beer and watch the world float by on the Amstel. Daan was great at communicating before and during our stay and flexible about checking in and out. There is nothing not to like about Daan's boat. I definitely recommend it."
785432,232784441.0,2/6/2018,54742515,Heather,Daan's boat house was an awesome experience. I have been to Amsterdam many times and never stayed in a boat house so it was a truly unique experience. The boats location is amazing. Super close to lots of good food and things to do. I would recommend his boat to anyone that wants a unique experience.

785432,233830709.0,2/11/2018,103575158,Andrew,Truly superb location. Warm and very well equipped. A short walk to all the best spots...right near the number 9 tram route and three stops from Centraal Station. Both bedrooms were very comfortable and it was so peaceful inside watching the boats go by. It 5 minutes to an excellent and large supermarket (good quality wine for less than 5 euros a bottle). Daan was responsive and (Website hidden by Airbnb) would highly recommend this place.
785432,234787284.0,2/14/2018,94605184,Ben,Amazing place right in the heart of Amsterdam. Highly recommended
785432,235883319.0,2/18/2018,75580273,Shona,"Daan and Monica were amazing hosts, very helpful and welcoming. The boat was perfect for our stay. It had everything we needed and was warm and cosy.

Would happily book it again!"
785432,237027773.0,2/21/2018,37522510,Andrew,"Daan's place is exactly as described and in an excellent location. Communication was also excellent. If I'm ever lucky enough to visit Amsterdam again, I will be looking to book this place. Thanks Daan!"
785432,237480800.0,2/23/2018,38628148,Rodney,Really enjoyed our stay on the boat. Perfect location for enjoying all that Amsterdam has to offer. Great for two couples to share as bedrooms the opposite end of the boat. Comfy well thought out accommodation with surprising amounts of space. Our stay was very cold but the boat has great heating. Communication from Daan was excellent. Recommended.

27886,101953754.0,9/16/2016,33054413,Sushma,"Flip was a great host! He accommodated us coming early and leaving early and it was so helpful! The breakfast he served was delicious and well thought out. The houseboat itself was lovely. We went in September and be aware that there are a lot of spiders around that time in Amsterdam but they are harmless (coming from someone who hates spiders) and none were inside the houseboat. The shower was better than I expected for a houseboat and was very refreshing with good water pressure. The toilet space is small but to be expected for a boat. The location is perfect. Super close to a bus stop and the bus system in Amsterdam is efficient. The bikes provided by Flip makes you feel like a real local. There is a small pier so that the houseboat feels more private and isolated while still being close to the main road and I loved that. Overall, an excellent stay and I highly recommend this place. "
27886,102339720.0,9/17/2016,71747970,Coral,Flip & Marjan were great. Flip helped us get a feel for the area and some awesome places to eat and shop. When we had to leave he helped us get a cab to get to the airport which was a tremendous help. Would definitely recommend! 
27886,103159034.0,9/20/2016,38324617,Emma-Lee,A perfect place to stay when exploring Amsterdam. Close to the central train station and CBD. The two bikes help to reach the hot spots which are a little further away. Flip is an excellent host. The breakfast served every morning in the room is very good. 
27886,105206204.0,9/30/2016,25595808,Carol,"Loved our stay on Flip's canal boat, perfect for a couple. We arrived early, well before check-in time, but were able to settle in right away. Breakfasts were amazing, such a treat to wake up to each morning. The boat's notebook suggested a handful of good restaurants nearby, we sampled two of them, and they were wonderful. So nice to be able to walk home from dinner. Quiet, restful, and excellent location. We took full advantage of the two bikes, perfect working condition, and would have taken out the canoe, but the weather turned before we could. All in all, it was a fabulous place to stay in Amsterdam, and we'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
27886,106243395.0,10/5/2016,26823141,Claudine,We arrived late in the afternoon and it was easy to locate from the central station. The place is easy to find using (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. The area is very secure and easy to access using taxi or bike or by foot.

27886,109239922.0,10/20/2016,21890894,Fabian,"The place is very close to the main station, a bus gets you there in no time! A 10-15 minute walk from the boat brings you to a bubbly lively area full of cafes and restaurants. It's very quiet, particularly cosy when rain drops fall on the boat - like camping, just a lot more comfortable! The place is equipped with everything you need, clean and nicely furnished. Make sure to take the canoe out if the weather agrees and swap trams and busses for Flips bikes! All in all highly recommended! "

And even though the location was close to the center of Amsterdam, the boat was peaceful and serene. <br/><br/>Breakfast was generous, and the hard boiled eggs were perfectly done. The centers had were solid, but still just a bit creamy. We were so full from breakfast that we skipped lunch most days. <br/><br/>Flip was always available for questions, and his knowledge was very helpful in planning our trip around Europe. "

Staying on the houseboat was super cozy and a very unique experience! The breakfast was absolutely delicious and he even accommodated some of my dietary needs which was nice! Eating breakfast on the boat, with the comfy robes he provided us was one of the highlights of our trip. He was also very accommodating with check in times. There were a lot of little nice details which made our stay a lot better! I would definitely recommend and stay here next time! Thanks flip "

The location was within close walking distance to the city center but away enough for a quiet and peaceful stay.  Waking up eating breakfast in such a tranquil place on the water with beautiful views was an amazing way to start each morning for us.  Flip was always available to answer our questions and help us find our way around the city.

785432,243278622.0,3/15/2018,59385661,Amy,"Wow! This was our first time visiting Amsterdam and we are so glad we stayed on Daan’s Houseboat for it! I felt like I was really taking a chance with this, and going out on a limb - but I needn’t have worried. Daan was a great host. The boat he lives on is very nearby, so he was right there when we arrived. It was so easy to get to from the metro station, just follow his instructions exactly and you will have no problems.<br/><br/>The boat itself was fantastic. It was comfortable and warm, and we slept extremely well. I was worried about the motion causing motion sickness, but that was not a problem. It does move a little with the water, but unless I specifically watched out the window to see it, I couldn’t even tell. <br/><br/>It had all the things we needed- coffee, tea, very well stocked dishes etc. The area the boat is docked in is right in the center of everything. We went across the street to the place Daan recommended to get bikes, and very easily biked all over the whole city. <br/><br/>I’ve stayed in 5 star hotels and I enjoy those too. But that was not what I wanted for this trip. This was a houseboat, on a canal. It felt like someone’s home. It has old wood floors, and is not super fancy and new. But it has everything you need - good lighting, good Wi-Fi, working TV and a stereo. If you are not good with small stairs, you will need to be very careful going in and out of the boat (or else don’t stay here if you fear such things- it’s not for you). If you appreciate the Amsterdam way of life though, where everything is easy going and laid back and you want to sit on a roof top patio and enjoy the city, then - this is the right place for you. Enjoy!!!"

Els is a great host, welcoming us with some grapes, stroopwaffles and apple juice!! Her english was outstanding and full of knowledge of Amsterdam. Would definitely return. "
528022,303450588.0,8/7/2018,111816379,Leanne,El’s place is a perfect spot for a couple. Whilst bus stop nearby that goes to Amsterdam central we enjoyed the short walk in and out of the city each day. So lovely to come back to the boat out of hustle and bustle each day after our exploring.  Hope to come back again 
528022,305999613.0,8/12/2018,25992922,René,Els Hausboot hat eine wundervolle maritime Lage. Es ist alles vorhanden um entspannt ein paar Tage Amsterdam zu erleben und sich zu erholen. Els ist eine tolle warmherzige Gastgeberin. Wir haben jede Minute genossen. Für uns hat sich ein Traum erfüllt...wir durften auf einem typisch holländischen Hausboot übernachten. Es war wirklich eine wundervolle schöne Zeit an Bord....Hartelijk dank voor het weekend
528022,307965193.0,8/15/2018,173201076,Jewgeni,The houseboat “somewhere else” is really beautiful and we had a very good stay there!<br/>Everything is clean and there is perfectly enough space for two people.<br/>Els is also a great and friendly person .<br/>We will make sure to come back!
528022,310976265.0,8/20/2018,25249687,Nadja,"We stayed at Els's boat for three nights. Els was super nice and flexible, we were able to check-in early and keep our luggage at the boat cause we had an evening flight back home. The boat was exactly as the pictures show, super clean and relaxing space. The location was the best. The ferries are near and you can basically walk everywhere from the boat. And if it's warm you can take a dip from the boat! The most magical place to stay in Amsterdam!"
528022,315548294.0,8/29/2018,9211423,Kim,"The location is interesting on the dock rather than inside a canal, but the boat is very nice."

785432,246309135.0,3/25/2018,4725531,Megan,Daan's place was awesome. It is a great location. Close to many tourist attractions as well as amazing restaurants. Daan was also very helpful and gave us a lot of good information on things to do and see. It was really fun to be right on the water and in the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam. I would Highly recommend the place!
785432,246785909.0,3/26/2018,178927012,Tom,A totally unique experience. You really feel like a local staying on a houseboat and I personally enjoyed waving to all the other tourists going by in the canal cruises! Boat is well equipped and stylish.
785432,247922893.0,3/30/2018,56441237,Aleksander B.,Fantastic way to stay in Amsterdam. Really made our trip complete. Boat was nice and warm. Daan is a great host.
785432,248877831.0,4/1/2018,13487312,Carole,Logement original qui a rendu notre séjour typiquement hollandais! Péniche confortable et environnement très calme. Emplacement idéal. Merci Daan pour l’accueil et votre gentillesse.
785432,250159932.0,4/4/2018,20171554,Joshua,"Daan's boat in the heart of Amsterdam is a unique and comfortable way to experience the city.  We were greeted upon arrival, which made check in easy.  Our stay was in early April while the city was still quite cold and dreary - I was worried that the boat might be cold and uncomfortable, but to the contrary it was plenty warm and VERY comfortable.  Daan was warm and hospitable.  The boat was clean and had all the amenities that we needed.  I highly recommend renting this boat if you are looking for a unique way to experience Amsterdam.  5 star experience."
785432,252368888.0,4/10/2018,70239814,Betsy,"What a fun stay on a houseboat! My family (two kids ages 9 and 11) had fantastic weather most of our trip, so sitting on top of the boat with a beer watching the tourist boats go by in the center of the city was as idyllic as you can get. I was impressed that we hardly felt any rocking at all, especially given how many boats went by during the day. <br/><br/>We loved the location - easily walkable to restaurants, shops, bike rentals, Metro and the flower market. One recommendation - don't take a car from Centraal station if you're coming in by train. The Metro (or walking if you pack light) would have been much faster.<br/><br/>Friday and Saturday nights were a bit noisy with late night clubs across the canal, but we were so tired from the day that it didn't bother us. The beds being comfortable helped too, and Daan had extra blankets and pillows stocked that we tapped into.<br/><br/>Daan has a bunch of DVDs stocked which made for a good way to unwind from a busy day sightseeing. The other reviews about the surprising roominess of the boat held true for us, and I appreciated that the two bedrooms were on opposite ends of the boat. <br/><br/>All-in-all, Daan's accommodations and hospitality made for a great first trip to Amsterdam."
785432,253753686.0,4/15/2018,150434164,Stefanie,"Super Unterkunft, mitten in der Altstadt, genau richtig um die Stadt zu erkunden. Alles wie beschrieben. Tolles Erlebnis auf einem Hausboot zu übernachten. Neben dem Inneren ist die Terrasse auch wirklich toll, vor allem bei Sonnenschein :)<br/>Mit Daan hat alles wunderbar geklappt. Sowohl beim Check in als auch bei der Abreise. Wir durften unser Gepäck zwischenlagern. Ein sehr netter, freundlicher Gastgeber."
785432,254854925.0,4/18/2018,52554618,Susan,"We have just had a wonderful couple of days on this boat. The location is perfect, the host is very helpful and welcoming, we loved sitting on the roof watching the river go by, and the quirky experience of staying on a houseboat. Would definitely recommend, and hopefully will go back"
785432,255023785.0,4/19/2018,875973,Dillon,Tremendous place to stay while visiting Amsterdam. We spent a few hours relaxing in the sun on the deck and it was the best part of our stay. There is no better way to experience the best that Amsterdam has to offer.
785432,256168969.0,4/22/2018,117464877,Axel,"Wir konnten 4 herrliche Tage auf Daans Boot verbringen. Es bietet eine super Ausgangslage für Besichtigungen zu Fuß oder für Radtouren, weil mega zentral gelegen. Man erlebt hautnah, wie sich die Einheimischen fühlen mit all den Touristenbooten, die täglich das Hausboot passieren. Daan hat uns ausgiebig erklärt, wo man alles findet, was man zum Leben braucht. Auch sonst stand er jederzeit für Fragen zur Verfügung. Check-in und Check-out liefen problemlos. Die Übernachtungen auf dem Boot sind schon etwas höherpreisig, aber es ist auch etwas sehr besonderes, was man sicher nicht jeden Tage erlebt."
27886,113921278.0,11/14/2016,1619305,Edwina,My husband and I stayed on Flips houseboat for two nights. We had a really lovely time. The weather was really cold during our stay and I was worried the boat would be cold but it was very cosy and warm with the heating on. The apartment is small but perfect for two. The bed is very comfortable. We slept so well and woke to a lovely breakfast each morning. It was a great start to our day! We didn't use the bikes as I found Amsterdam city too busy for cycling but we reached everywhere by foot. 
27886,115922213.0,11/27/2016,74965753,Cassandra,"We really enjoyed the two nights we spent on Flip’s boat and didn’t want to leave! It is such a wonderful, unique space and so well equipped that it soon felt like home. We slept incredibly well in the comfy bed and enjoyed the breakfast very much. I would definitely recommend Flip’s boat to anyone who is looking for somewhere quite unique to stay when they come to Amsterdam. "
27886,117284837.0,12/6/2016,13575831,Espen,"Good location, but also very very quiet. Great to have bikes ready for us. Three ovens makes it hot even in wintertime. Great breakfast. 2x bathrobes makes it seem like a spa. Should bring own slippers. Flip is an interesting guy, good conversationalist, even heard him practice singing with his family which was nice. "

785432,257712988.0,4/27/2018,10697933,Lauren,"This was a fun experience. The boat was clean, nicely decorated, provided coffee and tea, was conveniently located to the Jewish Quarter sites, tram/metro lines, and walking distance to many restaurants and bars. Bathroom facilities work like a regular hotel and the heat worked very well. Noise wasn't an issue with the windows closed at night. The boat moves slightly but it's hardly felt. Bedrooms are located on opposite sides of the boat. The only issue was the stairs to enter which are very steep and the doorway is very low so you have to be able to stoop low and climb out/in. This would be difficult with large suitcases or mobility issues."
785432,258566680.0,4/29/2018,129450290,Marianne,"Vi hadde en flott weekend i Amsterdam, da det var Kings day. Båten var ett flott utgangspunkt for å overvære alle som hadde fester på båtene sine på Amstel. Båten var utstyrt med alt vi trengte og mer enn det! Vi fikk til og med sjekke inn tidligere, da båten var klar. Takk for oss:)"

785432,265196431.0,5/16/2018,139937847,Aaron,Daan was great.  When our flight was cancelled he stayed up until our flight arrived and we reached his boat. The location is absolutely perfect and as centrally located as you can get. The deck on the boat was perfect for us to have a few drinks and watch other boats ride by.

Had a wonderful time on Daan's boat, especially since the weather was so nice. Sitting on top of the boat, having a beer while watching the other boats go up and down the Amstel, was paradise.<br/><br/>We stayed with 2 couples in the 2 full bedrooms. The boat is like a mini-house, full bathroom kitchen etc. Great location on the Amstel, 3 mins from Centraal via the metro, 20 min walk to Leidseplein/museums. "

785432,270399037.0,5/29/2018,159176467,Jeffrey,"Daan’s houseboat is just as advertised. What cannot be seen in the photos is Daan’s hospitality. Punctual and amending to all of our needs is something that we needed and he was able to help out. Also gave us lots of tips for sightseeing and getting around. The location is very convenient with a metro , supermarket and bike rentals nearby.<br/>For those with young kids (ours are 5, 4, and 2), the patio does not have a railing so may likely be used less. Also the dining table and chairs are of bar table height so children may be prone to falling off the chairs. (Ours did because they were too rowdy). Otherwise everything else is kid-friendly.<br/>If ever in Amsterdam again would definitely look to stay there again. Thanks Daan!"
785432,271411594.0,6/1/2018,14941278,Joanna,"We stayed here for my friends 50th as she had always wanted to stay on a houseboat and had never been to Amsterdam. This boat has amazing facilities, even a normal loo! Bathroom bigger than my own at home. We had amazing weather on the whole and the deck was great for watching the world go by. The positioning of it is perfect. We explored everywhere by foot or boat. <br/>Would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting a truly local experience in a fantastic location with a great host. Thanks Daan."

We loved staying on a boat it made our Amsterdam experience even more special. The captain's quarters is totally comfy with a huge king bed and Els provided fruit, coffee, cheese, butter and jam which was very welcoming.  There is a small fridge and microwave so you can prepare some food. Els was very friendly and made our stay easy and relaxing. There are groceries and restaurants nearby and we walked to all the major attractions in Amsterdam and took an easy tram back after a long day. The sunset from the boat was spectacular! We highly recommend this boat and Els is a great host thank you!"

Els' place was clean, nicely decorated and in a good location with all the bus and tram stops in walking distance 10 min or less. I had such an amazing time staying here, at some point, could even feel the boat moving on the water. Els is awesome, always quick to respond and will answer any questions you may have. It was an adventure staying on a houseboat and I enjoyed every moment. In the houseboat, there are so many windows for natural light and they is also a fridge in case you need to store food. The bathroom is a bit tiny, but it is perfect for max 2 people. The houseboat is ideal especially if you want an authentic Amsterdam experience."

It's located in a lovely and quiet area which is not too far to walk to the central parts of Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Flip is very friendly and the breakfast he brought for us each morning was generous and healthy!<br/><br/>There are a lot of houseboats to choose from but I'm extremely pleased with my choice to stay on the MS Luctor and would be very happy to stay again! We chose not to use the bikes or canoe on this visit but we'd love to try these out on another visit, perhaps when it's a little warmer.<br/><br/>If you're looking for somewhere to stay for a cosy, romantic getaway then you won't be disappointed if you choose to stay here.

We had plenty of everything we needed -- lots of bedding, plenty of towels and toilet paper, and a lovely kitchen and a bathroom which was tiled from floor to ceiling -- amazing on a boat!<br/>We loved, loved, loved the location.  What a treat it was to stay on a houseboat right on a canal in the middle of town.  Daan's houseboat is highly recommended!"

Beim CheckIn und CheckOut ist Daan sehr entgegenkommend, so dass man das Gepäck auch früher vorbeibringen bzw. bei ihm auch nach dem CheckOut zwischenlagern kann. Das Hausboot bietet alles was man braucht und ist ein außergewöhnliches Erlebnis, gerade die Terrasse ist bei Sonnenschein ein Traum :) Es war ein sehr schönes Wochenende und wir würden auf jeden Fall noch einmal wiederkommen! :)"

The houseboat was clean, well equipped, and a great space for the four of us.  But the best part - it’s right on the canal with gorgeous views out the window and on the upstairs seating area.  And it is so centrally located that we walked everywhere. This is a fantastic place to stay and experience Amsterdam!"

We were surprised at how quiet the area is and at how stable the boat was to live on and sleep in. The home itself is very clean and the owner is just 2 boats away and is very accommodating . It was a treat very evening to be able to sit out on the top deck and watch the world go by in their small boats. The people were very friendly and everyone was waving at one another. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who desires a restful, peaceful place to stay."

The bed was very comfy, the shower nice and warm & we were made to feel welcome by the host.  The breakfast is very good and plentiful...more than we could eat in fact.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place."

We've visited Amsterdam a few times before and this was the best accommodation by far! <br/><br/>Apart from being a beautiful boat and a superb place to stay, the breakfasts were amazing and the location is perfect - we even walked from the central station easily (but we were travelling light). <br/><br/>Flip was the ultimate host and really looked after us too - I'm sure we'll be back!"

27886,134936629.0,3/2/2017,16331627,Jacqueline,"We had a wonderful stay on the house boat. It was so much more than we expected, even better than the photographs portray.  The bed was very comfortable, the heaters worked very well. Flip was a great host, he brought us a beautiful breakfast each morning.  To have the use of two bicycles was great. The house boat is very close to the center of Amsterdam but far enough away to be relaxing. I would highly recommend Flip and his wonderful house boat to everyone visiting Amsterdam!<br/>Evan and Shebael Ireland"
785432,306007861.0,8/12/2018,39465507,Lars,"The canal boat is situated along river Amstel, a couple of minutes from Rembrandtsplein. It`s really central. The metro is one minute away. The boat is nice, and give you a totally unique way of experiencing Amsterdam. You can hear the city around you, but after midnight it is quiet. I loved it!"
785432,306732006.0,8/13/2018,1685240,Ben,"It's a damn boat in the middle of Amsterdam!  OK - you pay for the uniqueness, but man is this a great experience.  We only stayed one night but the evening and morning topside on the deck were some of our best memories of the city.  Amsterdam is expensive and touristy - but it's that way for a reason.  A really amazing place to stay - even if for only a night.  Details are all accurate in the listing - this feels like an upscale mobile home on the water.  plenty of space for four - as the bedrooms are split (i.e. one bedroom on each end of the boat.  Bathroom is surprisingly spacious and better than you would expect in a house boat.  Mostly - the place feels like a normal apartment but with lower ceilings.  passageways are tight and not suitable for people with any type of limited mobility, but for our family of four is was fine (and fun!).  Great place.  "

We loved sitting on the deck with our drinks prior to dinner and watching the canal boats and locals go by. Centrally located to anywhere. We walked everywhere. If you have mobility issues, you might have a challenge entering the boat so just be aware. Your host lives on the boat two spots down so you can always have easy contact. The boat is a relaxing way to experience this wonderful city."

It is at the end of a pier where you can watch all the boats go by; from gigantic cruise ships to tugboats to schooners to the ferries and more.<br/>It is close to the train station and I always walked, but there is a bus. <br/>Els left a few snacks which were very welcome.  There is a small frig and microwave and coffee & tea.<br/>With all the boats going by, you would think kit was noisy, but very quiet day or night.<br/>I want to return again & again."

It is situated within easy walking or cycling distance of all the sights and makes the ideal base for a holiday in the city. The barge is very comfortable and cosy and gives one a sample of houseboat life. Flip, the owner, is the perfect host, very welcoming and friendly. Each morning he delivers a breakfast basket full of delicious food which really sets you up for the day. We had a fabulous holiday here and cannot recommend this property highly enough."

Außerdem gibt es ALLES, was praktisch und angenehm ist. Dieses Boot ist nicht nur hübsch, sondern vor allem auch sehr durchdacht-intelligent eingerichtet. Wir sind verblüfft und voller Bewunderung. Die Lage könnte auch perfekter nicht sein. Wunderschöne Umgebung und gleichzeitig ein Katzensprung ins Zentrum. Die Krönung ist schließlich das grandiose Frühstück und die Mittel zur Fortbewegung inklusive. Und ganz besonders der so sehr sympathische Gastgeber. "

Flip provided a brilliant breakfast every morning that set us up for the day.  In particular, the freshly squeezed orange juice and still warm boiled egg were lovely touches.  Even though the boat is only 15 minutes walk from the central train station, the location was very very peaceful and quiet. The Westerdock bar around the corner (3 minutes walk) was very friendly with a great bar lady.  Highly recommended! "

Obwohl es mitten in der City ist (paar Min. mit den coolen Fahrrädern und man ist in der Stadt) ist es relativ ruhig dort . 15 min zu Fuss zu Central Station (Bahnhof). Das Frühstück hat wirklich ein extra grosses Lob verdient! Wir könnten immer draussen frühstücken bei herrlichem Wetter und tollen Ausblick!

Flip's place is everything you could want from Amsterdam.<br/><br/>The location is slightly off of the main tourist area so you get to be around locals and have some peace but are only a minute or two from a faster pace.<br/>Your also right near one of the free ferries that takes you to northern Amsterdam, so convenient!<br/><br/>Flip went out of his way to make me feel welcome.  He gave great local spot recommendations and even gave me a rain jacket the day that I got to see the ""real"" Amsterdam (aka ""wet"")<br/><br/>The breakfast he served each morning was a feast!  I felt very spoiled sitting by the water eating delicious treats.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this spot to anyone! When I come back to Amsterdam I will be sure to book here again.<br/>Thanks so much!"

The breakfast was delicious and very generous and Flip very friendly and informative. It was really useful to have bicycles to get around town, though a bit scary riding as we are not used to reverse pedal brakes and the huge numbers and speed of other cyclists. The nearby part of central Amsterdam is absolutely beautiful."

785432,342657809.0,10/29/2018,2534010,Nicola,The location was unbelievable and it was a great experience to get to stay on a houseboat. Would recommend this to anyone looking for an authentic Amsterdam break. The hosts were very accommodating in letting us drop our bags off early and allowing us to collect them later on day of departure.
785432,343356606.0,10/31/2018,58187768,Lindsay,"This is by far the best place we stayed on our vacation. The cutest, most quaint, houseboat. I wish we booked it for all of the nights we were there. It was so peaceful and cozy. Perfect location!!! Everything we wanted to do was within walking distance. Definitely worth staying here- Daan and Nathalie were amazing hosts and had great recommendations. Thank you again! We will definitely be back someday!!!"

785432,346573212.0,11/9/2018,97144766,Daniel,Lovely house boat. Nice and warm and very comfortable. Hardly knew you were on a boat other than looking out the windows. We seemed about 10mins from walk everything so ideally located. Great little bar and restaurants located 2 mins walk away as well. Really enjoyed it. Thank you.
785432,347887951.0,11/12/2018,3769118,Richard,"Very interesting place to stay. Very central location. Looking at the windows as the river activity goes by was a treat, swans, rowers and tourist boats all added to the ambiance.<br/>Very comfortable beds and bath with shower and tub. Daan was very helpful to us."
785432,349041786.0,11/16/2018,68232616,Maike,The house boat was such a great experience. It had all the amenities that we were looking for and we were surprised how quiet it was inside almost all the time. The location was perfect for exploring the main part of Amsterdam.
785432,349351212.0,11/17/2018,23291835,Hansag,This is a really cool Airbnb in a great location! The host is great and provided us with good recommendations. He is very accommodating and responsive. The spot has cool views and is very clean.

The hosts really thought of all the little things that make a stay comfortable and were very helpful and responsive every step of the way."
785432,351568016.0,11/23/2018,805720,Lisa,Super cute place and in the perfect spot. Great communication. Hosts are accessible only two boats away. All I needed. I’d stay again.

27886,210376972.0,11/9/2017,50813073,Kate,"Flip’s place is conveniently located, for easy access to Amsterdam. Being on a houseboat, will be a memorable and unique experience. The quarters are very clean and Flip provides a substantial breakfast spread. The pictures are accurate, however the space is quite small. Kitchen and laundry facilities are not available, there is a laundromat within a 10min walk and there are many good eating options around, be prepared to eat out every night though."
27886,211951525.0,11/15/2017,11342459,Dan,We had a wonderful stay on Flip’s houseboat!  All the reviews about Flip’s hospitality were so true and he proved to be the most kind and generous host.  The breakfast was wonderful and since we stayed pretty busy and made very early starts on most of the days on our trip Flip was kind enough to make a special trip to provide us with some sandwiches to keep us fed on our journey.   I cannot express enough how grateful we were for his hospitality.   As for the place it is perfectly as described.   Temperature dropped to just at freezing on our trip and we were worried that the boat would be cold but the heaters kept the space cozy and warm.  The bikes were a wonderful amenity and we made use of them to get around the city which was very helpful.   The space is wonderful and comfortable but is quite cozy.  It’s big enough for a couple to exist comfortably but you should be very comfortable with your partner as it is a pretty tight space.   That being said the bed was surely one of the most comfortable in all of my Airbnb experiences and we slept great while there.   Overall this place is highly recommended.
27886,212504047.0,11/18/2017,153425409,Alexandria,"Amazing 3 days spent on Flips boat. It is truley stunning and unique. The breakfast is fabulous. Location perfect, to see everything the amazing city has to offer. Would definitely recommend! Just fabulous 😊"

27886,222652945.0,12/30/2017,28505208,Sabine,"Wir sind Flop sehr dankbar, dass er sein außerordentlich schönes Plätzchen mit Gästen teilt. Sehr gerne kommen wir wieder, am liebsten im Sommer, um die tollen Zusätze wie Fahrrad, Kanu und Tisch am Steg zu genießen zu können. Aber auch das schlechte Wetter war nur halb so schlimm, weil wir uns an der mollig warmen Heizung und einem heißen Tee schnell wieder wohlfühlen konnten."
27886,224735417.0,1/4/2018,105077880,Nicholas,"If you are coming to Amsterdam then you have to stay on Flips boat. All the amenities of an apartment or hotel. Hot shower, comfy bed, good heat, and an amazing breakfast included. Very very clean and Flip is very thoughtful in the things he leaves in the space for you to use. Two free bikes as well, hard to beat everything that is included. Location is easy to get anywhere in a hurry as well, 5 min bike ride to central or Anne frank house."
27886,225350966.0,1/6/2018,18421614,Dorothy,Flips home was a great place to stay to get the full Amsterdam experience. The boat was so much fun and within walking distance of most things we wanted to see. Breakfast was great too! Would love to stay again.

528022,360650157.0,12/21/2018,205453552,Reidar,"this was a most satisfying stay. To sleep afloat in Amsterdam is perfect. Would not at all mind to stay in Somewhereelse again. Comfortably situated for walking all over Amsterdam, a nice, interesting and relaxed city, the last week before xmas. <br/>Highly recommended!"
785432,356433135.0,12/8/2018,182554653,David,Great boat in a great central location.  Whilst in the boat you can not hear the outside world!
785432,357471262.0,12/10/2018,33162850,Kara,Staying in a houseboat in Amsterdam was a truly unique experience and I highly recommend giving it a try. The location was perfect and very central to everything. We enjoyed waking up on the water and watching the boats go by. The space had all the comforts of home and was very warm in December.
785432,357930380.0,12/12/2018,7270324,Ellie,The houseboat was a great location and great space for two nights. Had a nice deck on the roof for watching Amsterdam life. Communication was fast. The apartment was well heated during the cold nights and had everything we need including coffee machine and dishwasher. The apartment could do with a refresh of paint to brighten things up but certainly nothing to complain about. Would highly recommend if you wanted a stay in the middle of things

27886,233141231.0,2/8/2018,17488097,Silvan,A very extraordinary place in the middle of amsterdam. Very cosy and nicely done house boat with love in the details. A perfect place to spend a few day's with your beloved person in the middle of this pulsing city.
27886,234302340.0,2/12/2018,12925289,Katherine,"Wow. Is all.<br/>Staying on Ms. Luctor was the perfect way to spend a mini break in Amsterdam. There is so much we could say about it but you really need to discover it for yourself. Our highlights were eating delicious breakfast whilst sat in the cabin overlooking the canal, the use of the bikes to explore the city, and being able to come back to somewhere warm and cosy after a very cold day.<br/>Thank you Flip - I hope we get to come back one day!"

Very novel, very romantic, and Flip our host was extremely hospitable, friendly and helpful. The breakfast is tasty and fresh (freshly squeezed Orange juice!) And can fill you up till the afternoon!<br/>We enjoyed ourselves very much!!<br/>Highly recommended!!<br/>Only one tiny detail- very tall people should consider that the ceilings are limited, they may have to bend over a bit, and bathroom a bit narrow. But otherwise, fantastic place!"
27886,249866624.0,4/3/2018,102500275,Gilles,Endroit atypique avec beaucoup de charme idéalement situé dans un quartier calme mais proche de la gare et du centre ville. Flip est un hote attentionné qui vous apporte le petit déjeuner tous les matins. La hauteur sous plafond est basse et à prendre en considération pour les personnes de plus 1.80m.
27886,250820225.0,4/6/2018,135215374,Nico,"We absolutely loved our stay on the boat. Fantastic view while having the excellent breakfast, everything clean and super comfy.

27886,259701109.0,5/1/2018,158015259,Amanda,The views of the canals from the barge are wonderful. The best part is having the amazing breakfast in the wheel house and enjoying the view each day. Flip's place is a must for a true taste of Amsterdam.

Nous sommes arrivés a 08h00 et en accord avec Flip,  nous avons  pu disposer de suite du logement;  les velos a dispos sont un plus, nous sommes à 5 minutes du centre et parfait pour se deplacer dans tout la ville. <br/> nous ne regrettons pas notre choix, c etait parfait"
27886,276548802.0,6/14/2018,45672076,Kelsey,"Flip's place was AMAZING!!! If you are looking at any other apartment or house boat in Amsterdam just STOP and book this one now! <br/>The boat's location is outside of the city center which is great for peace & quiet.  His boat itself is super cute and perfect for a couple!  Just a small note: I'm 5'4 and my boyfriend is 6'.  I  could easily stand on every level, but my boyfriend had to slouch a little on the first floor where the steering wheel is and on the bottom where the bed is.  That was no issue though since we didn't spend a lot of time in there anyway and he could stand in the middle floor if he needed to :) <br/>Three concerns you may have that I had: <br/>1) The shower is great/like a normal shower, including water pressure <br/>2) the toilet is like a normal one as well ( a little loud if you flush at night and your partner is a light sleeper)<br/>3) Even though you're on a boat, you can't tell. aka you shouldn't get ""boat legs"" or feel nauseous<br/><br/>Aside from the location and the boat itself, my other absolute favorite part was the thoughtful  breakfast he provided every morning.  Everything was DELICIOUS and it was so amazing and convenient to have it just ready for us every morning so we could get our day going ASAP!  He's very considerate of your privacy and makes sure the time he drops off the breakfast works for you. <br/><br/>He also provided two bikes which was incredible.  We literally took them EVERYWHERE.  The only slightly negative thing I can say is the girl's bike/smaller bike was a little squeaky/old, but it worked just fine!  <br/>There was also a super close bus stop, but we never used it aside from when we first arrived.  <br/><br/>another side note: If you get back late/want to stay in, UberEATS delivers there as well :) <br/><br/>I hope I didn't leave anything out!  I would 100% stay there again for a future visit, and hope that I can!  <br/>Seriously! Book this now!"
27886,277752710.0,6/17/2018,89310025,Laura,"Wonderful place, great setting and fantastic hospitality. Quiet at night and very comfortable stay with a lovely breakfast in the morning. Being able to bike around Amsterdam on the bikes supplied by Flip definitely made our weekend! "

27886,285928109.0,7/5/2018,37425121,GregnJoy,"Our adventure started with a no fuss check in, a casual bike ride (on Flips free use bikes) to the local store for cheese, crackers, wine and tapenade to settle in for our first evening on a gorgeous private little jetty overlooking the canals to enjoy our local feast. We were joined by Flip during the evening. He ensured we were checked in and comfortable and answered all our questions about the local attractions with warmth a smile befitting a generous host. Nothing was too much trouble and Flip even put the canoe in for us on the morning of our departure for a last minute paddle. The location is ideal. Close enough to the city to walk but far enough away to be peaceful. Can't recommend enough."

It was a 10 minute walk from the train station, and very easy to find.   The space was unbelievable.  There was more room  than we had anticipated in the shower, bedroom and lounging area.  Breakfast was waiting for us each morning with the option of eating inside or out on the jetty.

The location was sensational with heaps of great attractions very close by for our short stay. Definitely recommend renting a bike for a bit to get a real taste of Amsterdam transportation culture.

785432,410458739.0,2/10/2019,15500227,Welf,"I was on Daan's houseboat with family and friends. We had a beautiful stay on the houseboat. It is big enough, comfortable and has all the equipment needed. Victoria welcomed us and everything worked perfectly. There were some problems with the reservation but Daan found a way to make it work. We would definitely stay there again."
785432,411394705.0,2/12/2019,23970562,Shazia,"Nathalie and Daans place was an absolute gem in the heart of Amsterdam! A traditional houseboat with all the perks of a modern apartment. It was wonderful and they were very hospitable. Their friend/ co worker Monica met us at check in and explained everything, toured us around the boat, helped get our big suitcases down the steep stairs into the boat, and gave us local recommendations. The boat was well heated and there was plenty of room. Beds are SUPER comfortable and there’s nothing like coming home and being able to see the view of Amsterdam by night through the little windows in the boat. Check out was seamless and easy, we just had to drop keys off in the mailbox 2 boats down. Thank you Nathalie, Daan and Monica for making our experience so perfect in Amsterdam! Hope to come back soon."

27886,311809358.0,8/22/2018,28707080,Jennifer,Stay here! It is an amazing place!  So close but just far enough away to relax! The bikes are so very helpful on getting around town. Flip is a thoughtful and caring host! <br/>Thank you

785432,415291649.0,2/22/2019,6560927,Gail,"Just spent a long weekend on Nathalies boat as a family of 3. Perfect way to see Amsterdam- from the water, central position, warm and cosy at the end of a days sightseeing. Felt very homely, lots of space to relax and a terrace to sit watching boats go by when sun came out. So much better than staying in a hotel room."
785432,416791112.0,2/25/2019,25337554,Kathryn,"Although this place is within walking distance of all the sights and attractions, it was quiet at night. The houseboat is warm inside and very well-equipped.  The weather was very warm for February and we were able to sit outside at the back of the boat and watch the tour boats go by."
27886,318090271.0,9/3/2018,116900405,Emily,Flip was very  helpful and  considerate  of us and our allergies.  He was great to  chat too as well . Will  definitely  stay again  at this  romantic  house boat
785432,418076408.0,3/1/2019,21336685,Paul,"Book. This. Right. Now. <br/>Daan and Nathalie’s houseboat was the perfect space and location for truly enjoying the city. Comfortable as a refuge from a day spent walking. The beds and bedrooms are outstanding and the living room is a great space for spending time together. The shower is spacious enough with great water pressure. As a reference, we were a family of four including two teenage boys and we all had adequate privacy. I should also mention that we are a definitely plus-size and Daan’s boat was comfortable in all regards. <br/>Sitting on the deck managed to be somehow both engaging and relaxing. The foot, bicycle, and boat traffic set against the stunning backdrop of the neighborhood allowed us to breathe in this beautiful city. <br/>Daan met us, showed us everything on the boat, made us laugh a bit, and didn’t leave until he made sure we were comfortable. He was accessible the entire time as he only lives two boats down. <br/>Amsterdam is of course an expensive city, so the value of this houseboat can’t be overstated. Again, do yourself a huge favor and book this place now. Best experience I’ve ever had on AirBnB and I’ve had many great ones."
785432,419600340.0,3/4/2019,60356820,Kasey,"We loved staying here. The host allowed us to check in early and was very quick with responses. The location is great, as well. Very cool experience!"
785432,420327473.0,3/6/2019,77907827,Samantha,This house boat was absolutely amazing! The location couldn’t get any better ! Right on the canal in the heart of the city. Walking distance to many restaurants and bars! The boat itself was adorable and spacious! I would 100% recommend!!
785432,421993949.0,3/10/2019,45101817,Alice,"We had a wonderful 2 night stay on the boat. The location is fantastic - very central and easy walk to the main parts of Amsterdam. Check-in was straightforward, and the boat had everyting we needed. Highly recommended!"

27886,321831247.0,9/11/2018,109394420,Donald,"This boat is a gem. It is on a quiet canal only 15 minute walk to train station. Flip is a great host.  He brought a wonderful breakfast basket every morning with fresh breads, cereals, yogurt, and fresh squeezed orange juice. Check in was easy and the boat and bed very comfortable. Flip even printed our shuttle voucher to our next connection. The boat had a nice shower and coffee and tea maker. The dock was great for sitting on by the picnic table and it really feels as if you are living here. We even met his neighbour who is an eel fisherman. We would highly recommend the MS Luctor!"
528022,410416276.0,2/10/2019,238447496,Luciano,"Unique location, just enough faraway from the city center to enjoy the boathouse during the night, no noise around and just the sound of the water.<br/> You have your own privacy and if you wish to sleep until late in the morning you can do it.  If you like to walk, you can easily go around by foot as I did whit my girlfriend, in 15 minutes you are in the city center. The boat is clean and comfortable and Els is a really good Host.<br/>I spent four nights in Els' boathouse, If you want have a romantic experience, I really suggest it.  See you soon Els."

785432,424692201.0,3/17/2019,176572625,Lise Aardal,"Warm and welcoming hosts, great location and a cozy houseboat. We went as a family of four and the kids loved staying at at houseboat."
785432,426548719.0,3/21/2019,4740239,Carole,"The boat is in a fantastic location right at the Opera House and opposite the Ice Bar.  Everything is in walking distance.  There is a good and reasonably priced supermarket just round the corner and many lovely shops nearby.  The Jewish Museum is very close and so is the Zoo, the Resistance Museum and the Portuguese Synagogue.  Houseboats are never huge, but this one is extremely well equipped, with everything you need and the beds are comfortable.  Although it could do with a little makeover, it is very cosy and clean and there are plenty of clean towels etc.  Weather permitting you can sit on deck and watch the world go by, or if not, you can also get a great view from the kitchen - I would definitely recommend this place."
785432,427751507.0,3/24/2019,3953642,Megan,"This was an incredible Airbnb find and we highly recommend it. We stayed at the houseboat for 3 nights with our children ages 5, 2, and 11 months. Daan managed to get a crib for our baby so we didn’t have to bring one and it was so helpful. He was accessible and friendly and provided assistance when needed. We loved the neighborhood and generally walked everywhere we wanted. Our kids were tickled to stay on a houseboat and loved waving to all of the passing tour boats. This is a great spot to stay when visiting Amsterdam. Don’t miss it!"
785432,428451787.0,3/25/2019,18285991,Rodrigo,"The place was amazing, perfect location, completely clean and with everything that you need. Over my expectations."
785432,430307773.0,3/30/2019,92817500,Janet,"Nathalie's houseboat is the perfect home base for 3-4 adults to relax and explore Amsterdam.   The location in center city is ideal for walking or using public transportation.  Views out the windows in the morning were beautiful and there is a rooftop deck where one can relax and observe the city activity or the night sky.   Our group of 3 adults (a couple and a single) had no trouble sharing the bathroom, kitchen, and living room space. We cooked breakfasts, a lunch, and two dinners while there. The kitchen was adequately stocked with some of the basics such as tea bags, coffee, salt & pepper and we were able to purchase the other food items at two markets within a short walking distance.   The beds were very comfortable and we were able to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the houseboat despite the chilly and rainy weather at the end of March.  Nathalie/Daan were very responsive to my questions.  Check in and checkout couldn't have been easier.   It was a pleasure to meet Daan.  He was very helpful with local recommendations."

The location was perfect,  walking distance to all the sites. <br/>The beds were supper comfortable. Daan also arranged a birthday cake and wine for a special celebration. Thanks for a wonderful stay."
785432,433875838.0,4/7/2019,45209743,Veronica,"The host lacked interest in his guests: communication was impossible, we had no response from him whatsoever. Plus, the boat was missing some basic care."
785432,435392326.0,4/10/2019,126319979,Ben,Absolutely wonderful place to stay. The boat is located right in the heart of the city with everything you could ever need within a short distance including a canal stop only a few slips down. The major tourist destinations are only a short walk or canal ride away. We thoroughly enjoyed just sitting up on the deck and watching the boats pass by. Cannot recommend enough. Would love to return some day.
27886,323186118.0,9/15/2018,61851540,Megan,Flip's houseboat was an amazing way to stay in Amsterdam. The breakfast each morning was incredible. The location was great (close to Centraal station). The space was very comfortable and clean. I would recommend staying at Flip's place.
785432,436080984.0,4/12/2019,197588605,Tresia,Everything we needed. It was centrally located to several cafes and right there at a canal tour. Daan even set up our taxi ride to the airport at 6 a.m.

528022,418917358.0,3/3/2019,149698389,Becky,"A nice quiet space, great for a short break. Quite far away from amenities but fine once you get used to public transport. It’s worth noting that you only have access to a small area of the boat, but is a quirky and unusual place"

785432,476983873.0,6/27/2019,356912,James,Incredible location which lets you enjoy watching the boats and people. Easy walk to just about everything!
785432,479650586.0,7/1/2019,38594538,Jane,The location of the house boat is perfect. It could be doing with a little make over though as it's a bit tired inside. The beds are comfortable but possibly need some new bed sheets...they've seen better days. All in all we had a good stay and would be happy to book again.
785432,480686338.0,7/3/2019,28371175,Joerg,"Totally recommend to stay on Daan and Nathalie’s boat. It has the best location in Amsterdam, the boat was spotless clean, excellent amenities and very good and quick communication. Daan and Nathalie have been very helpful, nothing was a problem and a very special thanks to Monica who help with the check in and extra tips."
785432,481743774.0,7/5/2019,25039582,Jason,"The boat is an incredible location in the city, steps from the opera house, conveniently located on the Amstel river. you are minutes from everything you might want. A 20 min walk from Centrral. <br/>The host is two boats away so he is there to solve any problems with the series of boats he is responsible for, ensuring all the different residents behave themselves making sure you have a respectful stay. <br/>Please remember, canal accommodations offer an unprecedented spectacular POV of the city, but also bring the nighttime element. With a rooftop deck you are able to sit on top of the water and watch the world go by. Be reminded that world consists of a combination of responsible day time tourists and night time debauchery (use your imagination).<br/>Fortunately, Europeans are respectful and we witnessed no one going aboard anyone else’s boat after-hours. <br/>The only issue we had were ants in the kitchen, but bugs should be expected when you’re right on the water backed up to other boats.<br/>The host was willing to keep our bags after check out, which was incredibly nice considering there are companies that specialize in this business and he could have easily denied us and created an additional expense.<br/>The WiFi was great inside the boat but intermittent on the rooftop deck. <br/>Over all a great experience and one we would do again!"
785432,482995291.0,7/7/2019,63729744,Mitchell,We had a fantastic time staying on this house boat. Perfect location close enough to the city centre but just far away enough to not be fully in the noisy areas of town. Having the deck on top of the boat was great for chilled evenings enjoying the views. Nice little touches to the apartment like a coffee machine and tea bags were great little extras. Would definitely recommend this for your stay when next visiting Amsterdam!
785432,485059012.0,7/10/2019,4439447,Jennifer,Coolest location ever!!!
785432,490781337.0,7/19/2019,65853186,Donna,Boat is a unique experience and in a perfect location! Hosts were lovely. The boat does need some updating and doesn’t quite match the photos! But the location is beautiful and central

27886,349759831.0,11/18/2018,37556669,Joe,Flip's houseboat is phenomenal. We absolutely loved our stay here and the only complaint was that we didn't have a longer stay booked in Amsterdam to enjoy it longer. We were a short walk to the center of town but far enough away that it was quiet and peaceful. The breakfast provided was top-notch. Flip is extremely kind and when we come back to Amsterdam we will definitely make it a point to stay here again.
27886,352478109.0,11/25/2018,13146173,Jenny,Great houseboat - lovely quiet location but not far from the action. Flip was very responsive and helpful. Great having the bikes on hand - loved using those. We would definitely recommend this place to our friends.

27886,417190219.0,2/26/2019,46229559,Yash,"In Amsterdam I got live on both a boat and an apartment. If I were to do it again, I would choose the boat. The location is amazing and the boat is really cool. It has everything you need, including a private bathroom with a shower. Flip is a really accommodating host and did an awesome job with breakfast. The boat is really close to the main city where everything is happening. If you would like to amplify your Amsterdam experience, come stay at Flip's place."

785432,506887233.0,8/11/2019,66903303,René,"By far my most favorite Airbnb to date. It is spacious, homey, and has the roof deck that allows for some cocktails during sunset or coffee in the morning. It was so nice after all the walking/biking/exploring we did to come back to the houseboat and still feel immersed in the Amsterdam atmosphere. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else next time I come."

She was very kind and friendly amazing place I will recommend with my eyes close

27886,423469641.0,3/14/2019,5364881,Catherine,"This experience is not for everyone but I for one am glad I tried it and would stay again.  The boat is charming, interesting, unique, clean, comfortable and well situated. Having said that, it is not like a generic big box  hotel with instant hot water and little connection to the outside world. <br/> Personally, I was relaxed by the sounds of the water, rain and  calls of the birds.  I spend three nights here with my teenage daughter and despite the fact there was a television, it was barely turned on. I treasure the leisurely breakfasts we spend watching the water, the birds, the goings on around us and simply talking.  Something tells me the breakfast conversations would not have had the same quality had we been at the Hilton. <br/> Flip is a very accommodating host who respected our privacy but also made us feel very safe and welcome.  I am glad to have exposed my daughter to an alternative to big box hotels and would definitely stay again. Thank you Flip for your kindness and hospitality."

528022,442411050.0,4/23/2019,57535092,Alison,"Excellently located, and a lovely quaint experience to stay on a proper Dutch barge!  We enjoyed sitting in the wheelhouse at sunset with a bottle of wine (or two), and making friends with the kitties, and the huge bed was extremely comfortable at the end of a tiring day in the city!!  The fridge is enough to keep things cool, and the microwave for warming stuff up!! Communication with Els was 10/10.   Highly recommended.  <br/><br/>*Tip:  the No 48 bus takes less than 10 minutes to get to Centraal Station, and goes from just opposite the Pontsteiger (ferry) junction, or get the free ferry from Pontsteiger to NSDM, then from NSDM to Centraal Station for a great experience!"
785432,513327713.0,8/19/2019,114487331,Darby,"This has to be the best Airbnb in Amsterdam. What an amazing location, houseboat, and experience. For the rest of my life I will remember sitting on the deck, watching the boats with my kids. The space is great, the location is amazing, and Daan was incredibly helpful. I hope we end up back in Amsterdam someday and can stay at this houseboat again!"
785432,517154190.0,8/25/2019,31309690,Nicole,"The location of this houseboat is amazing, everything is walking distance and the Dutch National Opera is next door.  The accommodations were comfortable, all of the essentials were available to ensure a seamless stay. Furniture was a bit old but still useful, the host advised he is repainting and updating furnishings in the coming weeks. I recommend this experience to anyone who is up for something outside the ordinary. It was my favorite experience of the trip!"

785432,520393457.0,8/30/2019,15014674,Stephanie,"Nathalie was quick to respond and very informative. My group and I (4 of us) have never stayed on a boat before so this was such a neat experience! The interior of the boat was so cute we were in awe at how spacious it was for us. The bed was also very comfortable. It was clean and a wonderful experience. The boat was also at a nice location, it was about a minute walk from a metro station so public transportation was easily accessible! We would definitely stay again in the future!"

27886,454967607.0,5/19/2019,63583490,Camilla,"Our stay at Flip’s houseboat definitly made our trip to Amsterdam even more memorable. It was an amazing experience staying on a houseboat and made it even better starting everyday with the most delicious breakfast served by Flip. <br/>Only thing to be aware of (If you’re tall) is the low ceiling. But didn’t made the stay any less recommendable.<br/><br/>We also enjoyed the possibility to bike around in the City with the two bikes accesible - just like biking around in Copenhagen.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your kind hospitality. We will definitly come back, if we ever should visit Amsterdam again ;-)<br/><br/>Best regards, <br/>Emil & Camilla, Denmark"
27886,457552429.0,5/24/2019,164697280,Linda,Our favorite part about staying at Flip’s was beginning and ending our day with food and drink on the houseboat deck. As others have mentioned the breakfast was amazing and Flip was available for any questions we had.  The neighborhood across the canal was lovely to walk in and restaurants were close by. <br/>Probably not a great place for tall individuals as the bedroom is quite low and going up the stairs we both whacked our heads <br/>( it is a boat after all ).  <br/>I would highly recommend as it was quite charming.
27886,467887632.0,6/11/2019,152175788,Doug,"Flip’s boat was awesome. Being on a canal, in an old boat, was a fantastic change of pace from the hotels my son and I have been staying at throughout Europe. Flip is a great host, and the breakfast he provides every morning is not only delicious but plenty to hold you over until dinner. The houseboat also comes with two bikes which we fully used to get around. Just a great time and an enjoyable place to stay while in Amsterdam."
27886,468746046.0,6/13/2019,163591320,Ian,"Flip's house boat was amazing. We had the best holiday staying there. So clean, welcoming and in a great location. Wish we could have stayed longer. Can't wait to return!"
27886,479656861.0,7/1/2019,8657353,Meghan,Absolutely worth getting as your place to stay in Amsterdam. The breakfast is amazing and the space is super comfortable. We loved it!
27886,506974241.0,8/11/2019,96691687,Martin,"Das Hausboot ist mal eine andere Art der Übernachtung, passt aber super zu Amsterdam und den Grachten. Natürlich ist es etwas beengt aber für ein Haussboot ist das normal und eher gemütlich/kuschelig. Die eigene Dusche und (getrennte) Toilette waren genauso sauber wie das ganze Boot. Morgens gab es ein kleines, leckeres Frühstück - zubereitet von Flip. Zur Innen- bzw. Altstadt sind es ca. 10-15 Minuten zu Fuß. Schneller geht es mit den Fahrrädern, die im Preis mit eingeschlossen sind."
27886,517211855.0,8/25/2019,13095922,Clara,Flip’s houseboat is ideally located not far from the station but in a quiet neighbourhood. The space is great and we had everything we needed for a fabulous stay. Flip is a helpful and friendly host who helped us make the most of our visit. We really appreciated the bikes and the canoe!

Had bikes ready for us and lots of info about the sites to see.<br/>Small space onboard but that's to be expected on a boat.<br/>Flip provided a fantastic breakfast each morning and was lovely to chat to.
27886,528091290.0,9/12/2019,255872344,Liza,This was a great place.  Flip was a fantastic host. No recommend this houseboat.

27886,531378604.0,9/17/2019,46961209,Mariko,What a great experience! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a unique accommodation. Nothing beats waking up and having fresh breakfast provided by Flip on the canal. The use of bikes made a big difference and made the whole experience feel much more authentic.
27886,533172536.0,9/21/2019,90865678,Katharine,"Flip was an amazing host. His attention to detail is on point. The ability to use the canoe made the break. His introduction to the area, where to go and what to do made navigating the area much easier. Hope he gets many more guests. Thanks Flip."
27886,544815048.0,10/11/2019,47029901,Johanna,"Flip’s houseboat was the highlight of our stay in Amsterdam! He greeted us upon check in and gave us a tour of the houseboat and some great recommendations. The space itself is small but cozy! If you’re tall you’ll have to watch your head in some spots. We had to use the heat during our stay and it worked perfectly to keep us warm during the chilly nights. Flip was such a generous and thoughtful host and brought us a lovely picnic basket breakfast each morning. When we told him we’d be checking out early in the morning, he even offered to give us sandwiches for the journey to our next destination. Staying here was truly an experience to remember and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Amsterdam!"
27886,560546567.0,11/7/2019,89560625,Bryan,Lovely houseboat at the canal with a generous and fresh serving of sumptuous breakfast. Definitely will be staying again if we visit Amsterdam.

27886,570794040.0,11/30/2019,91181463,Caitlin,"We spent the latter half of our honeymoon in Amsterdam and stayed on Flip and Marjan’s beautiful boat. It was easily the most comfortable stay on our entire trip and Flip made us feel right at home immediately. The space is small by some standards, but it is so cozy we actually had trouble motivating ourselves to go explore every day. It would have been so easy to stay in bed and stare at the marina. Absolutely gorgeous.<br/><br/>Flip delivered us breakfast every morning in a picnic basket, starting every morning off with an incredibly generous and delicious meal, and he was consistently warm and friendly toward us, making himself available while also respecting our privacy.<br/><br/>If you are worried about the idea of a “shared” boat house, I can assure you you’ll completely forget the spaces are attached. It was actually quieter and more private than our own apartment in NYC, as well as clean and stocked with amenities. This was easily one of my most favorite AirBnB experiences. On our next trip to Amsterdam we will definitely be staying with Flip again."
27886,583717551.0,12/29/2019,290143157,Linnea,"Very comfortable and cozy little appartment. The breakfast was great! And the walking distance to the city center was more than fine.<br/>The ceiling is very low though, my boyfriend was only able to stand straight in the living room area. But we mostly spent our nights there so he wasn't bothered too much by that little discomfort.<br/>Thanks a lot for letting us stay in the Ms. Luctor, it made our weekend trip quite special!"
27886,585204310.0,12/31/2019,32663360,Jordan,Flip's house boat was amazing! I cannot put into words what a fantastic host Flip is. He thought of everything! The breakfast each morning was a favorite touch. He literally hand squeezes juice in the morning for his guests. We had a wonderful trip!
27886,586670593.0,1/2/2020,220064714,Francesca,"If you’re visiting Amsterdam you definitely have to stay at Flip’s boat. It wasn’t our first time in Amsterdam but this time was absolutely amazing. Flips hospitality was impeccable and the boat lovely. Everything was perfectly clean and the breakfast fantastic. Water was hot, as well as the rooms and the shower. We felt very comfortable from the beginning. Unfortunately we had to leave very early in the morning but Flip offered to prepare a packed lunch for us. Great service! Great hospitality! Great host!<br/>If we visit Amsterdam again we will definitely stay at Flip’s."

He was so kind to let us check in very early. The houseboat accommodations are spotless and have a great character. The breakfast basket Flip provided each morning was delicious and such a great way to start the day: croissants, homemade bread, jams, cheeses, hard boiled eggs, cereal, milk and orange juice. We had a great conversation with Flip and learned some things about Amsterdam we may not have heard about elsewhere. It was a great place to stay and we highly recommend Flip’s place."

Flip’s breakfast was also delicious! The location isn’t too far from a bus stop and it’s not too long of a walk to the metro either. If you’re driving there’s a very close parking garage.

He was always available by phone and easy to reach. The Canoe and bikes make this boat stay even more memorable.  I’m 6’ 2” tall and the ceilings in the wheelhouse and bedroom are shorter than that so if you’re tall, keep this in mind. Other than that, an excellent B & B in Amsterdam."

Flip was there when we had questions and served us a great breakfast every morning. The location of the boat is just perfect to discover the city. Just a few minutes from the heart of Jordaan. The boat has everything you need, showers and heaters comfortably warm and a super cosy bed. Definitely recommend the place to anyone visiting Amsterdam"

This is a great way to experience Amsterdam."

Very knowledgable on the local area in case you had never been before or had any questions. <br/><br/>Location of the boat is fantastic, within 10 minute walk of Amsterdam Square. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, we didn’t get to stay on this boat due it being in maintenance. However, even with short notice, the host let us stay on his boat, which he lives in two boats down. Even though it’s not the boat advertised, we appreciated the offer as apposed to refund and was still made to feel very welcome allowing us to use all amenities inc. food and drink etc."

You live on a boat on the inside of the canal - this means you get to see all the tours and tourists that are going through when chilling at top of the boat.<br/>Aside for that, the place was very clean and comfortable, and the location is great.<br/><br/>Daan is very responsive via (Hidden by Airbnb) /messaging.<br/>We had an issue with our flight that got postponed. Daan helped us and found a different boat to stay in for an extra night (it was relatively small, but it served out needs for the extra day).<br/><br/>I would recommend to anyone to have an Amsterdam experience in a boat, and this boat was really a treat."

Sitting in the wheel house for breakfast or an evening bottle of wine is amazing with stunning views over the sea channels feeding into the busy ports.

The quarters are simple, clean, and all you need. You also get the wheelhouse, where you can kick back and chill and watch boats glide in and out of the harbor area. I was initially concerned about head-room since i am 6' 2"", but it wasnt a problem and I could stand straight up in both the wheelhouse and quarters.<br/>Els was a great host and of ever we find ourselves in Amsterdam again, the Cornelia will be out go-to."

The main attractions are about a 15-20 minute walk. The apartment is surrounded by restaurants. The only thing I would say is that the wifi did not work for me, on the third floor. I had to go down to the first floor in order to use it. There was good communication before and after my stay. "

Edwin had a cute little coffee bar right outside of our room which was really nice in the morning. the bed was comfy, with a tv in the room (though we didnt watch it). It's located right above a really cute cafe, in a really cool area of town near the markets. Edwin did a great job of decorating with really unique art pieces. The best part was his kitty Pookie; she came up and hung out with us for a while on both days of our stay. The bedroom and bathroom were both spacious, well stocked, and clean. Edwin was super friendly and answered our questions and even checked to make sure we were having a good time! I'll definitely book this location again if and when we ever come back to Amsterdam!"

When leaving the boat, just around the corner is both an underground metro entrance and a surface-street tram stop. The boat itself was cozy and comfortable, with plenty of nespresso pods to keep you caffeinated. We enjoyed the trip!"

Space was clean and spacious for 3 adults and is well accommodated. Best part of this boathouse it the patio topside that overlooks the canal. Definitely not a bad place to spend a summer night."

Durch Corona waren zwar alle Events abgesagt, aber dank der genialen Unterkunft war es trotzdem ein perfektes Wochenende. Die Lage des Hausboots ist einfach super. Bei gutem Wetter konnten wir den ganzen Tag auf der Terrasse sitzen und den Ausblick auf die Amstel und die vorbeifahrenden Boote genießen.<br/>Das Hausboot ist praktisch, aber gemütlich eingerichtet. Es gibt 2 Schlafzimmer mit Fenstern direkt Richtung Gracht. Ein großes Badezimmer mit Badewanne und Dusche und einen großen Aufenthaltsraum mit Küche, Theke und Sofaecke. Wir werden definitiv nochmal buchen und bedanken uns für den tollen Aufenthalt und die vielen Tipps vor Ort."

785432,650011064.0,8/12/2020,192710433,Kati,The houseboat is a beautiful cosy home in a great location. Right next to popular bars and coffee shops but not so central that it is too noisy at night. The hosts were fantastic and responded quickly to any of our queries. It’s worth noting it is non-smoking but they have a beautiful roof terrace you can use to smoke and have a glass of wine whilst watching the boats go past on the canal. We had a lovely time feeding the swans on the canal and there were even places to swim near the boat. We’ve been to Amsterdam many times before but this experience was truly special. We will definitely be back.

785432,658320579.0,8/30/2020,4588751,Robin,La péniche de Nathalie et Daan est canon. Très bien située. Nous avons pu profiter d'un bel apres midi sur leur terrasse. Le coin est très calme. Les conseils de restaurant à l'entrée de la péniche nous ont bien aidé. On reviendra.
785432,659301544.0,9/1/2020,135688159,Christian,Absolute Empfehlung!
785432,660108107.0,9/4/2020,11831102,Jean Robert,"ATTENTION: La réalité ne correspond absolument pas aux photos !   A les voir sur le site, on s’attend à un logement propre, cosy, un peu tendance ou du moins élégant.  Simple mais joli.  La réalité est tout autre à tel point que nous sommes repartis sans y coucher et nous avons été chercher une chambre d’hôtel dans la ville.   Bref, les photos ne sont pas honnêtes: L’état général est vétuste (le logement a du être bien il y a quelques années mais il ne semble pas entretenu à part un coup de serpillière entre deux locataires). Le lit sur la photo n’existe pas, il s’agit aujourd’hui d’un simple sommier double. Les canapés sont jaunis, les accoudoirs des fauteuils crasseux, la table haute blanche est criblée d’impacts...  Nous avons perdu notre argent. Pour exactement le même prix pour 3 nuits (952€) nous avons été dans un 4* du centre ville (MGallery by Sofitel) avec petit-déjeuners inclus.   Bref, l’impression de s’être fait pigeonner....    Je tiens à disposition les photos du vrai état du logement, TRÈS différent de celles du site.  (et que l’on ne me dise pas que je suis exigeant ou que je n’ai pas l’esprit AirBnB pour en avoir fait à de nombreuses reprises aux quatre coins du monde... Pour que l’on fuie ainsi le logement c’est que la déception était à la hauteur de notre perte financière )"

Bedroom and bathroom small but clean and with confortable temperature. The street has some noise at noght but location is a must.

Midden in het centrum, maar wel met nodige ruimte om je heen door de ligging aan de Amstel. Boot is van alle gemakken voorzien. Laden en lossen kan op de kade bij de boot, mocht je met de auto komen. Wij hebben de auto geparkeerd bij Q-Park Centrum Oost aan de Wibautstraat. Is 20 euro per dag, kwartiertje lopen van de boot. Nathalie zit zelf vlakbij dus als er wat is, is ze snel ter plekke. Communicatie verliep prima. Uitchecken ook, allemaal heel relaxed. Zeker een aanrader om een keertje (of vaker :) te doen."

Also very accommodative to requests and helps with the check-in of heavy luggage especially with steep stair access into the boat.

785432,4.27979e+17,8/13/2021,417654156,Florian,"One of the best places ever to stay right in the middle of Amsterdam. <br/>Fully okay when you are not used to stay in 5 star hotels. <br/>Bakery, Supermarket, tons of Restaurants and Bars right around the corner."
785432,4.31625e+17,8/18/2021,135361754,Marc,"We loved our stay on this boat! Everything was functional, there was plenty of space for the three of us. We never ceased to be fascinated by living on the Amstel, in this perfect spot! Sitting on top,of the boat, watching all the ships go by, having a coffee or drink just can’t be beat. For me, this is the perfect way to stay in Amsterdam and I would (will) do it again in a heartbeat! Daan was a great host, very nice to talk to. With8n a few minutes you have restaurants, bakeries, groceries, and the beautiful historic center of Amsterdam."

785432,4.43184e+17,9/3/2021,29525134,Erik,"If you want to truly experience the unique life of Amsterdam during your stay, this is the place. We had an amazing time. Very comfortable sleeping and living areas, but you’ll be spending most of your time on their incredible roof deck waving at passing boats and sipping wine. The location is also perfectly central to so many of Amsterdam’s best sites. It’s also right next to a metro which is great to get to Centraal station for day trips to cities like Utrecht. The manager lives a few boats down and is very responsive. Great stay!"
785432,4.48304e+17,9/10/2021,392219408,Peter,"Sehr nette Gastgeber, optimale Lage des Bootes, volle Ausstattung. Nicht alle Fotos entsprechen dem derzeitigen Stand der Einrichtung. Etwas abgewohnt. Hat aber trotzdem viel Spass gemacht!"

So central - walking distance to bike rentals, grocery, great bars, great restaurants and the metro. And to top it off, Daan & Nathalie are so cool and kind. Cannot recommend more!!"

Would definitely recommend!!!"
28871,139052062.0,3/23/2017,27213859,Camille,"Le point fort de cet appartement est qu'il est vraiment bien situé, à quelques pas du centre et dans une rue animée. Si vous avez le sommeil léger, pensez juste à amener une paire de boules quies car la chambre n'est pas très bien insonorisée. Sinon la chambre est très propre, bien chauffée et le lit confortable. La salle de bain est petite mais fonctionnelle. <br/>Edwin s'est montré très disponible et réactif. Il nous a bien expliqué comment rejoindre son appartement. Pensez à le prévenir si vous êtes allergique au chat afin d'éviter une visite de son adorable maine coon. <br/>En bref, je vous le conseille :) <br/>"

Quiet and out of the bustling city. Bus 48 is 2 stops away from central hence the convenience. The boat is cosy and just nice for the two of us. Loves how it rocks you to bed at night and the bed is perfect! Els gave the best hospitality adding some fruits and tidbits. So accomodating! Would recommend this place if you want to enjoy some peaceful time."

28871,143050828.0,4/10/2017,26590145,Yatzury,This place is a gem! Is in the middle of everything. I walked everywhere and there are a ton of restaurants and bars in the area if you don't want to go too far. Edwin is amazing and was clear in his communication and he was very helpful with any questions or requests i may have. Keep in mind this is in the middle of a busy area in Ams if you are looking for a quiet place this is not it but if you are looking to have the best time stay here. 
28871,143987472.0,4/14/2017,90587247,Sophia,"Staying at Edwin's was a real pleasure. He's a really friendly person, who has nice hints on what to see in Amsterdam. The room was clean, nicely decorated and the wifi worked. If we'll ever be back again, we will definitely come back. "
28871,145445691.0,4/18/2017,4569313,Kevin & Evelyn,"Edwin's place is great! We stayed for a short stay over the Easter weekend and absolutely loved it's location and convenience to all of the sights and to the central station to catch our next train. The room was very comfortable and just as listed. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the shared bathroom was kept tidy. We would definitely recommend staying with Edwin, he is very friendly and made sure we were comfortable during our stay. "

Das Zimmer hatte ausreichend platz und das Bad war direkt nebenan.<br/>Von den Mitbewohnern haben wir nichts mitbekommen.

Dommage que l'on ne l'ait pas vu du reste de notre séjour après notre arrivée....<br/>Le lit est très confortable mais la rue à côté du logement est très brillante jusqu'à tard dans la nuit... Et pas de chance au moment où nous sommes allés dans le logement d'Edwin, il y avait des travaux dans le bâtiment d'à côté et donc réveillé très tôt le matin...."
28871,150447273.0,5/8/2017,15334952,Arisa,Edwin the host is very friendly and helpful. The place is clean. The bathroom is shared with the other room but it's totally fine. The location is really really great too.  It's close to various restaurants and shopping streets and supermarkets and all kinds of shops which is perfect for people who like to go out at night. The only downside is that it's not might be considered walkable for some from the central station but there's a tram station literally 1-minute-walk away from the place.<br/>My personal tip: do not bring large luggages because you'll have a problem drag them up the steep and narrow stairs
28871,150954014.0,5/10/2017,118827861,Troy,Edwin was a great host and his place is directly in the middle of anywhere you would want to go.

Easy to get to Central Station, Anne Frank, Heineken, Hard Rock.   Lots of walkable restaurants.   Only reason didn't give five stars is it is a noisy neighborhood till wee hours.

It was easy to get to from the central train station and fetch the key, even though we arrived quite late. Very central, without being touristy, with everything you might need located in the immediate area. The boat comes fully equipped, from making food to relaxing in front of the TV after a long day, and has Wi-Fi that actually works! In the evenings you can sit out on the top deck and enjoy the genuine ambiance of Amsterdam in a truly unique manner. Our hosts were super friendly and helpful with everything we asked about. Highly recommended, would definitely book again in future visits to Amsterdam!"

On the canal, walk to EVERY place in the city, next to a Metro stop, safe, clean, fun, you are on a (Website hidden by Airbnb) (Website hidden by Airbnb) a canal...with a host who lives next door and is super friendly and helpful. I can't wait to come back and stay longer. We slept well, didn't notice any rocking on the water, this is a long and heavy boat with canal views. We drank wine on the upper deck and watched all the tourist and locals pass by. Very well lit area and we felt safe walking back well after midnight. You can stay in any hotel in any city, but how many times in life can you stay on a house boat in Amsterdam! Do it, don't over think it."
785432,6.1216e+17,4/24/2022,6531977,Donna,"Great location on the canal, steps from the metro and tram, but also within walking distance of a lot of what you want to see in Amsterdam. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace and watching all the boats going by. Kitchen is well appointed and we enjoyed breaksfasts there after getting some groceries from a nearby market. Check in was easy - because Daan met us at the boat and walked us through everything. Daan and Nathalie also had recommendations for restaurants and events happening while we were there, like the spring festival. All in all, a really unique experience! Sunset from the deck is not to be missed."

La ubicación excelente, a 10 minutos andando a cualquier parte de Ámsterdam y plaza dam, está a metros del mercado de flores, a otros tanto de cruzar este y comenzar la calle de los locales de comida rápidas i locales de resto propios del lugar, casinos al paso y Coffee Shop ah!

Bathrooms/ showers/ kitchens all exceed what you’d expect even at a non-boat place. It felt so special to be down on the water and we felt very at home. Thanks!!!"

The location was very easy to get to from the airport and Edwin gave us great instructions on how to reach the place. Edwin himself is hilarious and probably the best Airbnb host I've ever had. The location is in the center of the city, with the flower market right around the corner along with great bakeries, coffee shops, etc. There's a supermarket around the corner as well. Everything is walking distance which is super convenient and if you choose to take the tram, it's located one street away. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone going to Amsterdam. The room was very clean and spacious."

Great shower lovey and hot. Nespresso and ordinary coffee machine, just remember milk! Enough cutlery and crockery to cook with.  Has heating and air con. Loved seeing all the boats going by. Easy access from Amsterdam central number 14. Supermarket 5 min walk.  Daan was amazing so helpful and was near if you need anything. We will be back as it made the holiday."

It’s a houseboat, not a 5 star luxury hotel, have realistic expectations and you won’t be disappointed! It’s been updated and well preserved, but it is an older boat taken great care of-huge perks-ease of access to transportation, everything at your reach! Very accommodating hosts! They allowed bag drop after our early arrival. We had one small maintenance issue that was quickly addressed and resolved. Hosts easy to communicate with, would definitely stay here again and recommend! Why stay in a stuffy hotel when you can have prime real estate on the river! Enjoy the roof top patio! Of note there are two house boats side by side, this is the one with unobstructed views of the river, however the other house boat patio is separate but right beside this one, when all are roof top it feels a little less private… but we had no issues with our neighbors☺️"
528022,525670489.0,9/8/2019,258899167,Danny,"Els’ place was a pleasure to stay at,  and it added that something different to our stay in Amsterdam. We were made to feel welcome and although a little bit difficult to find at first we would definitely  stay again. And guests must visit “ PIKOTEO” a Tapas restaurant and bar literally a 5 minute walk away. Overall the whole experience was something we’ll always remember. And that includes our City Treasure Hunt which is also a great way to see Amsterdam."
528022,531262192.0,9/17/2019,40038716,Tatiana,"Els was super patient,  we got lost riding bikes in a town near by and got delayed check in time. Els was super patient and understanding. The room is beautiful, clean, and safe. We had an amazing time while staying with Els. There is lots of near by places to walk to for drinks and food. Great location. I will definitely stay with her on my next visit."

Thanks for the extra touches."
528022,548291617.0,10/17/2019,290548645,Timothy,"Beware if you have a strict timetable, as this location is very relaxing. The bed was so comfortable and we slept one planned day away with the gentle rocking and light rain sounds against the skylights. Totally worth it.<br/><br/>It was a marvelous experience once you acclimate to the movement of the boat. The bed is large and soft, with a variety of amenities available in every nook and cranny. The bathroom ran well, the shower hot and revitalizing, despite the small size. A small porthole allows you to take in the view while you freshen up.<br/><br/>Transportation is close, and I recommend a trip down to The Breakfast Club for a bite to eat and the market down at The Pipe. I'd have stayed longer if I could."

There is always boat activity to watch and you can enjoy it by sitting on the top deck.  Be aware that the boat is not handicap accessible as the entrance is across another boat, through a low door, and down steep stairs into the boat.  We were able to walk from the train station and to all our Amsterdam sightseeing.  The location cannot be beat!"

528022,572246731.0,12/2/2019,10710473,Natalia,Els is a very nice host and her place is so cozy and special! We had a very relaxing time. Her boat is beautiful and the view is amazing.
528022,573454549.0,12/6/2019,12069817,Shihan,"Els boathouse is a well equipped boathouse. It is clean and wake up to a nice view as it is located at the last pier. The place is a little out of place because we didn't like taking the trams. Near enough to uber to most areas like Jordaan and Amsterdam Centraal which cost about 6-8 euros. Wonderful experience, once in a life time and a great escape from the busy city life"

528022,580196995.0,12/22/2019,164666124,Milly,"Me and my boyfriend had the loveliest time staying on Els’ boat! We’d recommend this place to anyone planning to visit Amsterdam. A 15 minute walk brings you to the main part of the city, so pretty close to the liveliness of Amsterdam. The weather during our stay was really wet and cold but the boat was so cosy and snug which was great. Staying in a boat in Amsterdam was such a wonderful novelty! The best part of our stay was being able to sit up in the wheelhouse. It was just heavenly sitting up there, with a cup of coffee in the morning or drink in the evening, looking over the water and watching the boats pass us by. Els is a really friendly and relaxed host, making us feel very welcome. She supplied us with tea, coffee, and some lovely cheese and other snacks in the fridge. We’ll definitely be visiting again!"

We walked with cases and it took only 20mins. <br/>We were met and welcomed by Els and she left us to our own devices, but with the message that if we needed anything all we had to do was call.<br/>The wheelhouse and living accommodation was spotless and a joy to spend time in.<br/>As said already it’s a 20min walk back to the centre but there are ferries, buses and trams etc to use if you do not want to walk.<br/>The weather wasn’t kind for us, so we spent many late nights with a glass or three....of vino in the wheelhouse watching the comings and goings of the many boats in front of us on the River IJ. Heaven!<br/>So all we can say is don’t hesitate to book this lovely accommodation!<br/>You won’t regret it at all....we didn’t!"

When we were staying here it was quite warm so we needed to have the window open. I'd suggest bringing earplugs. If you're a light sleeper maybe look for something in a quieter area. I knew what to expect so it wasn't a problem for me and my wife. I would definitely stay here again!"

Inside all is accounted for, bed is comfortable and also works for tall people. Everything Amsterdam had to offer is at walking distance.

Numerous forms of transportation are located close by. The houseboat is very clean and spacious with 2 bedrooms and a large sofa as well. There are plenty of DVDs, books, and games for entertainment, as well as a tv with many, many channels. The wifi is fast and works quite well. The hosts left nespresso pods, sugar, butter, and spices. The kitchen is well equipped.  We truly enjoyed our time at the houseboat!"

But you rarely get all these in one package, don't you. With Els we got all that and much more. It's hard to explain how happy we are we chose this boat for our vacation. The communication was perfect from the very beginning. The place itself is the best spot in town, period! Safe, serene, living by the water aboard an amazing ship with all the conveniences you can dream of and an awesome host. Walk 10 mins and you're in the very heart of the city, be it on Singel or Central station. By bike - less than 5 mins. I would stay here again and again and again. We did not realize until we got there how valuable the wheel house is. With its comfy sofa, cozy wooden interior and 360 view of the harbor and all the ships maneuvering on IJ it was magical to spend a few hours there in the afternoon, evening, or even sometimes during the day when the weather goes bad.<br/>You can never go wrong staying with Els at Cornelia. Actually (and that coming from someone who's lived in town for a while) it's the best choice.<br/><br/>Thank you so much, Els, take care and I truly hope we seer you again next year!"

Diverse Parkhäuser in kurzer Distanz. Auch Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und die U-Bahn sowie Tram Station sind in unmittelbarer Nähe.<br/>Auf dem Hausboot hat es alles was man braucht. Der ""Balkon"" ist ein Unikat. Ein tolles Erlebnis, ein Apero oder Kaffee zu geniessen und den Schiffs-Verkehr zu beobachten. Und ja, es ist wahnsinnig viel los auf der ""Schiffs-Autobahn"".<br/>Das Boot ist alt und ein wenig ""abgewohnt"". Aber es hat seinen Charme. 🤩 Wir kommen gerne wieder. 😊"

785432,6.955e+17,8/17/2022,93368943,Jonathan,"Overall nice place & you definitely want to stay on a houseboat in Amsterdam! As all the reviews say, the location is terrific. We thought we were going to rent bikes, but it turns out that the biking culture is somewhat treacherous. We were more than happy to walk everywhere or take a tram. City is small, lovely, and easy to explore by walking. This is a great home base.<br/><br/>Our main critique of the houseboat is that it needs some updating. It looks beautiful in photographs, even ours, so the owners are not trying to mislead you with the gorgeous photographs here. But when you come down the stairs there is a weak floor that you worry if you step down hard your foot would fall through; it needs immediate repairing; the trundle bed has a rip through the mattress; and the couch has seen better days. The deck no longer has the furniture in the photographs; only four not-very-comfortable metal folding chairs now, no table, which would make eating outside while watching the river even more enjoyable. None of this spoiled our stay. Just trying to provide a realistic review.<br/><br/>Sitting on the deck and watching the boats go by alone makes this place worth it. We were here when it was hot, and we were grateful for the A/C: it made it possible to sleep. The owners were always ready to help.<br/><br/>Overall, very good stay!"

528022,5.96906e+17,4/3/2022,1926623,Matylda,"We had a wonderful weekend on board Cornelia. Everything went smoothly, and Els is a great host. I was a bit nervous about sleeping in a boat, as I am not very sea-worthy. But I haven’t slept this good in a long time, even with the strong winds outside. We can definetly recomend a stay at Els."
794322,3585294.0,2/19/2013,4885151,Richard,"My girlfriend & I visited Amsterdam once before in a group, and after taking one of the boat tours around the canals, we talked about how cool it would be to stay in one of the houseboats... So for her birthday this year, I decided to make it happen!<br/><br/>On our previous visit, we booked an apartment through an agency - the holiday was great, but the apartment we stayed in was not as described on the website, 20 minutes tram ride outside of Amsterdam centre, totally soulless, and expensive too. So this time, we took a look on airbnb - after finding this amazing houseboat we requested our dates, and within a day they were confirmed. We are so glad that we did!<br/><br/>Everything about our trip was perfect - Lydia was totally friendly & helpful leading up to our arrival, and her boyfriend even met us from the station and walked us to the boat, showing us interesting things and suggesting places to go along the way. When we arrived at the boat, Lydia had gone to the trouble to surprise my girlfriend with a huge balloon and Happy Birthday banners in the boat - how many hotels do you know who will do that?! And inside was a bottle of wine, and some crackers & Old Amsterdam cheese - such a thoughtful touch, and very welcome after travelling.<br/><br/>We were shown around our accomodation (which is as small as you probably expect, but designed so perfectly & cleverly that it feels just right for two people), given just a couple of simple house rules, and then left to enjoy our time at the boat. Our host even offered to take us for a drink and I'm sure they would have shown us around etc., but we were happy doing our own thing.<br/><br/>The boat itself is beautiful, cosy & warm, and although it's actually shared with the hosts, the part you'll stay in is entirely self-contained - you won't even realise that Lydia is there (unless you want to!). The basics are all great (heating, hot shower, comfy bed - tick!) and the location is just superb. You can literally see Waterlooplein market from the window, all the essentials (like Albert Heijn, Coffee Company and the legendary Bluebird coffeeshop) are 2 minutes walk away, and it's only about 10 minutes walk to Dam Square & the red light district (oh come on, you have to go at least once!) - you don't need a tram, and you won't feel like going out is a chore.<br/><br/>I can't recommend Lydia & her amazing boat highly enough, we had a brilliant time that we'll remember forever and would love to return one day - if you are thinking about booking a stay here, DO IT - you definitely won't regret it!"
794322,3616553.0,2/26/2013,2957884,Rosanna,"We had a lovely weekend whist staying in Lydia's houseboat. The boat is lovely - it's very cosy, well equipt and was very warm despite it snowing outside! The location is also perfect for sightseeing across Amsterdam. Recommended!! "
794322,3693996.0,3/4/2013,5234645,Joseph,"This was an AMAZING place to stay!  The boat is in a great part of Amsterdam (Very, very central) and the interior is fabulous.  Lydia and her boyfriend were so great to us, giving us info on what to do, places to go, and they even provided us with wine and a variety of foods and drinks.  This was a great and very authentic way to see the city!!  I can't rave about Lydia and this wonderful boat enough!!  If we return to Amsterdam (which I really hope we can!) I would stay here again."
794322,3769570.0,3/12/2013,5349223,Etienne,"We stayed in this lovely houseboat in mid-March 2013. We were absolutely thrilled with it !! It really made a huge difference to our stay , especially as poured most of the time we were in Amsterdam.<br/>This houseboat is quite literally the IDEAL place to crash if you ever come to Amsterdam for a weekend or a holiday. The interior, of a good size, is decorated with a lot of taste and is extremely cosy. Attention to detail is everywhere. For instance, we were delighted to find dozens of candles scattered around the living room in case you were looking to create an intimate atmosphere. In addition, everything works perfectly. It was absolutely freezing in Amsterdam those days we were there and the heating stove worked prodigiously well  - it takes less than 5 minutes to get the temperature to that of a sauna ! <br/>The area literally oozes Amsterdam-style trendiness... We really felt we were in one of the most charming and most vibrant parts of the city, happily distant from the biggest tourist hotspots, yet a few minutes away on foot from all major landmarks. <br/><br/>Lydia (and her friend), who conveniently lives on the other side of the boat (which is completely separate and has its own access), was lovely to us from start to finish, picking us up at the train station, giving us lots of recommendations, offering us to have a drink if we felt like it etc. (Many thanks again Lydia !) It was also great to arrive late at night and find that she had bought for us all essentials for a solid breakfast and a decent dinner (including some wine !) – really appreciated.   <br/><br/>I’m now deliberately looking for negatives, but really can’t find any, especially in view of the price which is very reasonable. I give my 100% recommendation to Lydia’s houseboat.<br/>"

You get the real “Amsterdam” feel when you stay here. It’s close to everything and only a short walk to the red light district, the main strip and dam square.

It is a very family-orientated area but even as a group of young people there were still a lot of nice cafes, restaurants and bars to visit.

The room is a good size, and the house is a lovely traditional dutch structure. We were able to explore the city on foot due to the central location. At night, the neighborhood comes alive and is quite loud. We slept with ear plugs in and were just fine. Also, if you've never experienced dutch architecture, the stairs are often closer to ladders; which we found fun and charming, but may be an issue for people with even slight mobility issues.

It is in a great location just 5-10 minutes from Dam square and Rembrandtplein so everything is in walking distances. The area is also very quiet at night and has restaurants, cafees and supermarkets close by.  The owners are very warm and welcoming, they even stocked the fridge with some stuff. It was a delightful experience, truly to recommend.<br/>We will definitaly consider to stay here again the next time we´re in Amsterdam!"
794322,4831963.0,5/28/2013,5072337,Rebecca,"My husband and I stayed on Lydia's houseboat for two nights.  Our stay was wonderful.  Lydia's boyfriend, Chooki, met us on the boat and told us about the area.  He was very friendly and gave us some good tips.  The boat is adorable, clean, and very well appointed.  Lydia had left us wine and cookies, as well as some pantry and fridge essentials.  The bed is in a little nest behind the ladder, and it was SO cozy, even though the weather outside was chilly for our whole stay.  The boat is perfectly located.  We were right next to restaurants, stores, and bars, and all the sites were within walking distance.  Tour boats go by all day, and we had a lot of fun sitting on the deck and watching them.  Even though it is lively during the day, the area was very quiet at night and we slept very well.  We would definitely stay here again!"
794322,4883195.0,5/30/2013,5734867,Emily,"Our stay at Lydia's houseboat was nice. Overall, the experience of sleeping on a houseboat for two nights was pretty neat, and she really went the extra mile by taking note of the fact we were on our honeymoon and leaving flowers, treats, and champagne for us! <br/><br/>The space was clean and tidy, and the photos are on par. The only negative for us was the the bed was pretty small,, but we are both really tall. Otherwise I rather enjoyed the ""nest"" feel of the bed!<br/><br/>We would stay here again."

The pictures don't do the boat justice, it has everything you could possibly need (including an umbrella which came in very handy!). The location was perfect, right next to tram and metro and about a 5 minute walk to Dam. We're already planning our next trip back!"

But best of all the boat in itself is an experience, it contains everything you need and is really cozy decorated. Allthough there are plenty of nice restaurants in the neighbourhood it's just as lovely to make your own supper and eat it on deck watching the canal boats passing by. Lydia and her boyfriend are the most friendly and easy going hosts and also very helpful. We would love to come back. "

We spent a whole day riding bikes all around the canals, it is absolutly beautifull!! Staying on the deck of the houseboat watching the boats go by and the sun go down was just delightfull.The kitchen is handy, everything is very clean and cosy!

It was perfect for a family with 2 children, clean, very quiet and nicely decorated.<br/>The area is very pleasant and not far from the tram station. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the heart of the city which is ideal.<br/>I would strongly recommend this flat in order to discover Amsterdam in good conditions."
538723,13883606.0,6/7/2014,2794902,Peter,"My 2 colleagues and I had a great stay in this fantastic, spacious, ground floor apartment. It is located in a very cosy neighbourhood, with a park, public transport, take-away sushi, and some cafés nearby.

They made our trip to Amsterdam easy, were incredibly easy and friendly to communicate with and even gave us some extra tips about where to go. Their home was super clean and we were given free reign of the tea and the fancy coffee machine which were both lovely extras. It was just a fifteen minute tram ride into the centre of Amsterdam.

Ze heeft ook handige adviezen schrijftelijke achtergelaten van de buurt en welke restauranten, supermarkten en bakkerijen daar zijn. <br/>In samenvatting: een aanrader!<br/><br/>"
538723,19461184.0,9/13/2014,15951326,Yasmin Mattich,"Our stay at Dimphy's apartment was great! Though the family was already in holidays, the hand-over of keys was uncomplicated (they organized a person who give us the keys) - and a letter with all detailed informations about using the machines or the next store around the corner were there in case of need.<br/><br/>The house looks exactly the way as it's described in the profile: It's modern, cosy and tastefully furnished. There were two bedrooms: one with a double bed (it fits for two people) and the second one with two separated beds. Both were really comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped with all kind of machines (good quality coffee-machine, washing machine and even a dishwasher for the lazy people :)) and spices. We had Wi-fi and an iMac Computer which we were able to use during our stay. <br/>Also an advantage: The bathroom (with bath tub AND shower) with separated toilet. When you're around 4 people in the morning who're awake at the same time, definitely a good idea.<br/><br/>The house is located in a calm area with family atmosphere, so a deep and safe sleep is guaranteed. It takes 7 minutes to the next Albert Heijn supermarket and 6 minutes to the nearest tram station No. 9, who will drive you in about 20 minutes directly to the city center. <br/><br/>Conclusion: We really enjoyed our stay at Dimphys house. He made our arrival/stay as easy as possible. We would book this wonderful apartment at any time again.  <br/>"

Ideale uitvalsbasis om Amsterdam te verkennen. Uitstekende bakker, grootwarenhuis en openbaar vervoer met vlotte verbinding op wandelafstand.

Die Wohnung ist modern und  geschmackvoll eingerichtet.  Sie verfügt über ein großes Wohnzimmer, zwei getrennte Schlafzimmer, eine sehr gut ausgestattete Küche, ein modernes Bad mit Dusche und Wanne, und ein getrenntes WC. Die Wohnung liegt in einer ruhigen Wohngegend, was uns ein langes Ausschlafen garantiert hat. Trotzdem ist man mit der Straßenbahn ohne umzusteigen in 20 Minuten im Zentrum. Die Geschäfte für den täglichen Bedarf sind fußläufig schnell zu erreichen.Die Wohnung hat  der Beschreibung entsprochen. Wir waren begeistert und  können die Wohnung nur empfehlen und unsere Erwartungen übertroffen. Leider konnten wir wegen des Wetters den ebenso schönen Außenbereich  nicht nutzen aber das ist nur ein weiterer Grund um einmal im Sommer wiederzukommen. <br/>Vielen Dank"

And he really did! But what was a true suprise, is that even I loved the boat!! The boat itself is super charming, and in a really nice neighboorhood. We felt like locals, and we got an truly autentic Amsterdam experience that we would never had if we stayed in a hotel. <br/>The houseboat is in a really great location, as it`s in a really quiet and nice neighboorhood, but at the same time has everything around the corner. <br/>The best thing about the whole trip actually ended up beeing sitting on top of the boat in the evening time, and just looking at the life in the canal.

And the hosts were amazing : full of good advices about Amsterdam, places to go to... The houseboat cannot be more in the center of the city! You can go everywhere by foot. I highly recommand this place ! "

794322,10836868.0,3/10/2014,5873189,Lia,"We had an absolutely amazing weekend on the hosueboat.<br/>This place is just perfect. It is so sweet and absolutely romantic there.<br/>Lydia warmly welcomed us and showed us around and explained everything. They made a lovely little Guide with some Tips around the city and some restaurant reccomendations, which also were very helpful, because it was our first time in amsterdam. <br/>The place is so great and the city so lovely, that we will definitely come back and sleep on the boat.<br/>The best thing to do in the morning? Have your first coffee in the sun, on deck of the boat, with a fantastic view. I think is is one of the most autentic ways to stay in amsterdam and evrything is so close and central.<br/>It was also perfect for us, that Chooky & Lydia are flexible with the Check-Out times. Because no one else was arriving, the day we have checked out, we were able to stay a whole day on the boat and we were able to check out any time we wanted.<br/>I sadly haven't met Chooky, but we had a very nice conversation on the phone, when we checked out.<br/>We will definitely come back, because we absolutely loved that place.<br/>Thank you two for a very special weekend!"
794322,10974324.0,3/16/2014,1635836,Anne,"We had a wonderful stay on the houseboat in Amsterdam.  Chooky met us out front when we arrived and gave us a great introduction to the city.  Lydia and Chooky have put together a visitor's guide to the city with maps and local recommendations, which was very helpful.  The houseboat is really in the center of the city and provided a perfect home-base for all our sightseeing. My husband and I will definitely stay here again if we visit Amsterdam again soon (which we hope to do!). "
794322,11345190.0,3/31/2014,10753440,Jason,"We had an excellent time at Lydia and Choocky's adorable houseboat. It was very well located on a quiet canal. The deck was a great place to enjoy a glass of wine and watch the sunset. Lydia and Choocky were very gracious hosts, and gave good tips about Amsterdam. We'd love to stay in their boat again, next time we're in Amsterdam. "
794322,11628591.0,4/9/2014,10322236,Claire,"Had a great stay at Choocky and Lydia's place. Choocky was there to greet us and gave us a lot of useful information about the surroundings.

794322,11684903.0,4/12/2014,12431045,Nigel,"Chooky and Lydia are great hosts and we had lovely time on the Houseboat.  Really good local knowledge helped us make the most of our short stay (too short!). The houseboat is clean and the fridge is well stocked so we didn't need to go to the supermarket when we arrived (They even left us a bottle of wine!).  We would love to stay again but for longer next time, Thanks  "

Im Gegenteil! Hohe Decken&<br/>Ausreichend Lichteinfall, Bad mit Dusche...<br/>Eine echt kuschelige außergewöhnliche <br/>Atmosphäre&gastfreundlichkeit.<br/>Alles ok, das einzige echte Manko war das<br/>Bett für uns, nicht die Größe, sondern die <br/>Durchgelegene Matratze und die nach <br/>Zigaretten riechende/n Bettwäsche/<br/>Handtücher."
794322,12266628.0,4/28/2014,10559525,Roz,"The highlight of our trip was this boathouse. The bed was really cozy, and we were able to cook breakfast and eat outside on the deck of the boat every day. It was nice to just sit on the top and watch the boats passing by on the canal too! Choocky and Lydia were great hosts, very laid back and friendly. Would love to stay there again one day!"

We will definitely do it again and recommend to anyone who would like to experience a true Amsterdam holiday.  Loved every minute of our Amsterdam holiday."

The location is great, but the decoration is something just incredible, with so many cute details, and the bed was excellent, too. <br/>We enjoyed the top of the boat a lot. We had breakfast and a romantic evening there, too, with candles and the romantic view of the canal.<br/>You can't possibly ask for more! Really!  "
794322,14051258.0,6/10/2014,16005943,Jeanette,"This is the best houseboat to stay at in Amsterdam! It is cozy and romantic, super centrally located, but in a nice cozy side street where there is no noise at night. Just around the corner there are plenty of restaurants, cafes and little shops. You can walk from there to almost every major tourist sights, so we only used the trams once during the 5 days when we stayed there. Choocky & Lydia are the best hosts, they are so sweet and helpful. We would definitely recommend this houseboat to everyone we know traveling to Amsterdam."
794322,14158540.0,6/13/2014,15181547,Gaby,"My stay at Chooky & Lydia's houseboat was absolutely wonderful! Located in a perfect area with the boat just as shown, they were magnificent hosts. With an extremely delayed flight, we arrived quite late, but Chooky was so nice in accommodating us, and giving us advice on everything you could want to do in the city. They went above and beyond, stocking the refrigerator with a variety of food and drinks, and left us an extremely helpful ""guide book"" on experiencing Amsterdam. Without hesitation I  strongly recommend staying with Chooky & Lydia during your time in Amsterdam, they truly made our experience perfect! "

28871,325309463.0,9/19/2018,80531148,Danni,Edwin is a lovely host and has a lovely house too! The house is really authentic and has a cool vibe that you wouldn't otherwise get with a hotel. Staying in his house makes you feel like a local with the winding stairs inside and old style building. Being so central is also great because you can walk anywhere or jump on the tram which is close by. I definitely recommend!

538723,310342394.0,8/19/2018,25241431,Naomi,"From booking through checkout, Dimphy was a wonderful host. She was very helpful while arranging check in and check out, and left us great tips for local places to eat and hike rental. Her flat was extremely comfortable, and perfect for a longer stay. My family and I loved spending time in the back garden and the kitchen was perfect for staying in and cooking together. Her place really felt like a home away from home.

We very much enjoyed our stay, I would highly recommend staying here to others!"
794322,14280246.0,6/16/2014,5898346,Michael,"We had a wonderful stay on Choocky and Lydia's canal boat. The location is perfect, nestled on a quiet canal off the Amstel river and centrally located. Choocky met us and gave a useful orientation to the area and the boat's amenities. The kitchen was well stocked with food for breakfast, snacks, coffee, tea and a bottle of Dutch red wine (who knew?). The boat itself was comfortable if a bit rustic. It brought back childhood memories of the boat we had in Long Island when I was a kid. The sleeping area was a cozy nook and the bathroom did have that typical boat smell. Sitting out and watching the marine traffic go by while sipping wine was delightful. Dinner at U6 restaurant was accompanied by a jazz duo that quickly became a sextet! Our only disappointment was the somewhat spotty wifi internet that worked only in particular locations and dropped service often. I'm guessing a router/repeater will solve this easily. I highly recommend this canal boat to anyone looking for a real Amsterdam experience. "
794322,15143523.0,7/3/2014,6862130,Brian,"Everything is exactly as described. Perfect location, wonderful hosts. The fridge had enough food for us to make breakfast and there was a whole book full of their recommendations of restaurants/activities in the area. <br/><br/>The ladder getting in and out is a bit steep - but no problem as long as you aren't frail/broken.<br/><br/>We'd would loved to have stayed longer!"

Choocky was extremely welcoming and friendly, helping us settle in by showing us around the boat. Choocky and Lydia had put together a book with helpful tips on how to get around, what we might like to see and any recommendations they had. <br/><br/>The boathouse was exactly as had appeared in photos and the description. It had everything you could need and want for the stay as well as being very cosy with candles to set a lovely mood. The deck had gorgeous little chairs and table overlooking an amazing view of the canal, bridge, shops and surrounding houses. <br/><br/>Very central to everything you could want, we walked everywhere. Although being central it was surprising nice and quiet at night so you could still sleep peacefully. <br/><br/>We highly recommend Choocky & Lydia's gorgeous houseboat, we were very sad to leave as we had such a great time. We would definitely stay again. "
794322,15756343.0,7/15/2014,9571934,Lars,"Very nice stay, the boat was perfect for a weekend with the wife, much better than a hotel. Location is perfect, a bit off, but still only a 5 min walk to get into centre. <br/>Host is very nice and helpful, boat is nice and clean with all you need. The fridge is filled with food and drinks when you arrive, could not ask for anything more, would come back anytime:-)"
794322,15902863.0,7/18/2014,12693037,Damian,Chooky's houseboat was a very unique place to stay and experience Amsterdam.

794322,18645778.0,8/30/2014,11415331,Jessica,"I just got back last night from a fabulous stay at Lydia and Chooky's romantic houseboat.  It was just perfectly charming, and better than I had hoped for. My husband and I arrived later than anticipated due some confusion on our part with the train, but Lydia was so kind and understanding upon our arrival. My husband was unfortunately sick from food poisoning, and immediately had to go to bed. The houseboat was quaint and decorated with a, zen-like vibe, with host gifts of wine and traditional Dutch wafel cookies that were to die for. Lydia was super helpful with tips on where to go and what to do, and even gave me a personal tour of the area, bringing me to get food and showing me around, since I was going out alone for the first night. We talked and laughed and she made me feel so welcomed and that I've known her forever.  Her neighbors were also so open and friendly. I think my favorite part of the entire stay was hanging out and talking with the locals. I also just loved sitting out on the deck, drinking tea and watching the boats and bicyclists go by.  The location of the boathouse is close to everything you can imagine, yet feels away from the crowds. Right across the canal was a great flea market where you can shop from cheeses to clothing. The only negative thing I can say was I wish we could have stayed longer. I hope to go back one day to spend more time in this beautiful city. Thank you so much Lydia. You made the stay an unforgettable experience!"
794322,19406444.0,9/12/2014,16216901,Jessica,"Stayed in Choocky & Lydia's gorgeous houseboat with my boyfriend. Choocky was very friendly and gave us lots of tips on the city. The boat is in a perfect location, and is lovely sitting on the deck watching the other boats go by. The kitchen was fully equipped and we ate on the boat nearly every night as it was so cosy with all the candles lit! We had an amazing time in Amsterdam and staying on the houseboat made it extra special!"
794322,19514236.0,9/14/2014,16502920,Laura,Amazing personal service. The food in the fridge was a pleasant surprise and the birthday cake was a very nice touch. Lived up to expectations beautifully furnished and very romantic. Location was perfect and smack bang in the middle of Amsterdam. 
794322,19613647.0,9/15/2014,8247780,Martin,Great place. Great location. Choocky made us feel very welcome. A really nice place to stay on the weekend. 
794322,19733351.0,9/17/2014,13462714,Sarah,"Our stay at the house boat was absolutely perfect! I was a little nervous, as it was my first time using airbnb, but it could not have been better. During our stay we had only met with Chris (who I think is Lydia's brother?) but he was very nice and seemed understanding that we arrived later than expected. He provided suggestions for things to do and places to eat, and more importantly pointed out which areas to avoid late at night and also where to find cheaper groceries. In fact, both nights we ended up chatting with him on the deck which was really great. <br/><br/>The boat itself was clean and perfect for what we needed, and the bed was comfortable. I loved sitting on the deck watching boats go by. I found the wi-fi to be a little spotty. It worked a little better if only one of us was trying to use it, but I will say that we had hit or miss connections all across Europe so it wasn't just here. <br/><br/>The location ended up being even more central than I had thought. We would wander around the city and then turn a corner and be much closer to 'home' than we thought. Everything was in walking distance, even the main train station (although a bit of a hike with luggage- about 25 min)<br/><br/>I found staying on the house boat to be much more enjoyable than other cities where we had stayed in hotels. I highly recommend staying here. It really added something special to our experience in Amsterdam."

We really enjoyed our week-end thanks to Lydia who made us feel at home with surprise attentions.<br/>The house is warm and cozy even in November and all is at 5 minutes walk.<br/>Highly recommended !"
794322,23360032.0,11/30/2014,20729354,Nathaniel,"Absolutely perfect! Lydia was the perfect host and made us feel at home instantly. The boat is in the best location possible, with everything on your doorstep. Inside it's beautiful, decorated to perfection, tranquil and homely. You have everything you need and more and Lydia was kind enough to show us the ins and outs. There's wifi and a big folder full of local things to do, allowing us the make the most of our time in Amsterdam. I can't recommend this houseboat enough, it really made our holiday! "
794322,23815055.0,12/11/2014,10975959,Sophie,"We had a gréât time at Lydia's boat. Central location and Easy access to everything in the city. The place is very clean, tidy, warmly and romantic. Lydia made us feel very welcome. Would absolutely recommend and would like to stay in Lydia's boat on another occasion"
549310,38836431.0,7/19/2015,30411229,Esra,"Barbara was fantastic at communicating to us all the details. She checked on us even after our stay. Her place is located very close to the Centrum and only a minute away from the tram. The listing was exceptionally family friendly, particularly since we have a 13 months old daughter.<br/><br/>The only thing that wasn't clear from the listing is that the second bedroom is located in the garden. Other than that everything was as pictured. <br/><br/>Overall, we had an amazing experience in Amsterdam. Thanks to Barbara, Tsur and the family!"
549310,39748411.0,7/26/2015,31665286,Joy,"We loved the apartment! The kitchen is amazing and well stocked with pots and pans. We enjoyed being able to make meals at home. You are walking distance to an excellent part of town with restaurants and only a couple tram stops away from Dam Square. Also, biking from the apartment into town is super easy and quick. It was great to be away from the crowds in this lovely, modern apartment. We enjoyed sitting outside. I would definitely recommend this apartment to folks looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam.<br/>One thing to note: the description says it is a three bedroom apartment but it is a two bedroom with a ""garden room"" outside the house in the backyard. This was different from what I expected but it worked out. The Garden Room has a toilet but it was not as nice as staying inside the apartment."

En la casa hay instrucciones para toda duda que pueda surgir :D una gran experiencia, GRACIAS"

Barbara was not available to show us around, however her friend was very helpful and nice and took her time in her giving us directions and information about the house and surrounding areas. The apartment is very cosy and very kid friendly. Our children loved the toys and kids room. All in all, a great experience. Would definitely recommend. Thank you! "
794322,24737444.0,1/2/2015,7282743,Mark,"We had a brilliant time on the house boat around new years eve!  Lydia was a fabulous and very generous host,  made us feel very very welcome.  The boat is very cute, quiet and comfortable (and nice and warm!) It couldn't be more central, you easily walk anywhere in the centre of Amsterdam.  Altogether making a great place to a city break with a difference.  Definitely would recommend it and I hope to be back again soon!  THANKS LYD!  "

She had everything set up for our stay including wine, candles, and a few snacks. It was exactly what we needed after our travels. The houseboat was very cute and cozy; exactly as pictured. The location was very central and easy to move around. It was absolutely beautiful! I definitely hope to be back soon! Thanks Lydia!!!  "

When we boarded the boat, Lydia was thoughtful enough to set out a nice bottle of wine and well organized maps/tourist materials to make our stay in Amsterdam absolutely fantastic. I would definitely recommend this house boat if your'e planning a romantic escape in Amsterdam. This is definitely a nice and unique way to surprise your significant other. "
794322,26609799.0,2/16/2015,26170986,Robbie,"We had the perfect romantic Valentine's weekend on the boat.  The host was wonderful and had laid out some beautiful little romantic touches in the boat - roses, chocs, wine.  The location is absolutely ideal in a quiet side canal just off the Amstel, with no traffic noise.<br/><br/>The boat is very cozy but with plenty of room for a couple.  The sleeping area is set right in the prow of the boat (that's the front to you landlubbers!) and is a lovely area to snuggle up together.  <br/><br/>The kitchen has everything you need for a short stay, though no oven.  There's plenty of room to lay out a spread on the dining table and a comfortable sofa to relax on.<br/><br/>There's a couple of seats up top on the boat to sit outside for a smoke/drink and to take in the atmosphere, or to wave at the occassional boat passing by.  It's hard to find anything more relaxing than sitting listening to the water lapping the sides of the boat and occassional church bells tolling in the distance (which are never loud enough to become a problem)<br/><br/>If you can force yourself to leave the romance of the boat for a while to see the romance of the Old Town, it will be lovely and warm when you get back.<br/><br/>Lots of independent shops, restaurants and some great vintage clothing stores in the surrounding area and a fabulous market on the opposite side of the canal, which is ideal as you can shop then pop back to drop your bags off before heading out to see the sights.  You can check the market is on by peeking out of a porthole when you wake up!  <br/><br/>If you've never shopped in Amsterdam before, make sure you leave plenty of extra room in your bags for on the way home! A large supermarket is also less than 5 minutes walk away.<br/><br/>Within 5 minutes walk are Nieuwmarkt square and Rembrandtplein if you want more hustle and bustle, and you can easily pick up a bicycle rickshaw at either (highly recommended if you're dressed up for a night out, or just for a different way to see some of the city).  Dam Square is about 10 minutes walk away.<br/><br/>You really can walk to anywhere within the Old Town from this central location.  If you're not up to walking far you might struggle with the steps down into the boat, but if you do need to take a tram or metro anywhere they are both very close.  The hosts provide a book with lots of information about the city and how to get around.<br/><br/>Overall this was by far our best city break experience and I will certainly be recommending it to other couples I know who want to experience the incredible romance of Amsterdam as the perfect accommodation to do it from."

794322,28221330.0,3/20/2015,28606363,Beck,Lydia was amazing. She greeted us with the biggest smile and warmest welcome. We had red wine frim her and lots of items in the fridge for a continental breakfast. She gave us directions for local attractions and made us feel very very at home. The boat is so beautiful and we r booking again for the summer. Its so central but far enough away to have a peaceful night sleep. Cannot recommend enough and miss the boat and Lydia already. Brilliant romantic break x
794322,28584139.0,3/26/2015,8847853,Nicholas,Lydia was an absolutely perfect host. Her house boat is charming and comfortable in a great location. Her communication was excellent and prompt. <br/>My wife and I had a wonderful couple of days there and we couldn't recommend it enough
794322,28790220.0,3/30/2015,11973204,Markus,"It was already my second stay on the boat and I definitely will try to come back again as soon as possible. Personally I don't think there's any better way to live in Amsterdam, in particular with the welcome package (Wine, food, sweets...) from Lydia. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is also nice: little bars and restaurants, small shops, supermarkets (even an organic one) an most of the interesting places are just one hop away. <br/><br/>I already miss the sitting on top of the boat, watching city life and boats pass by while drinking a glass of wine and listening to the tower bells chiming nearby... hope to be there soon."
794322,29261191.0,4/6/2015,2426650,Louise,"Best holiday house in Amsterdam!<br/>This houseboat is beautiful with a comfy cave bed and a smashing shower; the entire place has been modernised really well but still has the cutest of original touches. Even with a thriving flea market just across the canal the street is really tranquil. The deck is like having another room to enjoy a drink, people-watch and wave as the tour boats go past. The location is excellent; Centraal station is about 15 mins walk, the red light district is close enough to walk to on a whim, but far enough that you'll never hear a stag party go by. There's a supermarket and off licence less than 5 mins away, a nice friendly coffeeshop (Bluebird) even closer and lots of adorable (not touristy) shops about and most of the must-see attractions are within easy walking distance . <br/>Lydia could not have been a better host, leaving us lots of yummy supplies; a bottle of wine and an Easter tree with lots of little eggs. Even aside from these treats her welcome was so warm it's very clear that she loves having this space to rent and wants people to really enjoy their visit (and also lets her guests know about giant pillow fights :). She also supplies lots of handy holiday bits; an alarm clock, 2 umbrellas, a hair dryer, mini sewing kit and shower gel, as well as a great book with tips on the area and places to see (check out the Phrases to know in Dutch - she thinks of everything ;)  <br/>If this boat is available for your dates, stop looking right now and send a request, you are not going to find a better spot.

794322,29809621.0,4/13/2015,20137946,Paul,Lydia was a great host.  Really friendly and welcoming - with a bottle of wine and fridge full of breakfast items.  Also gave us a lovely surprise birthday gift! She really goes the extra mile.  Boat is in a great location - central but also quiet!

Also, the host is lovely, he even gave us tips to go to another little town, but we couldn't go there yet. I'm sure I will go back to Amsterdam a couple of times, as it's quick and cheap from England, and I'll probably stay at Edwin's guest house, cause it's really nice and chill. Thank you Edwin, for being a great person and running a nice place ♥ :)"

Vielen Dank noch mal an Dich, Lydia!!!!"
794322,31932780.0,5/12/2015,25966235,Thomas,We loved staying on Lydia's boat. My wife and I stayed on there for two nights and our only complaint is that we didn't book it for longer. Lydia was awesome. We were a little late getting there and she was so sweet and nice to us. She had wine and treats for us for our honeymoon. We loved sitting on the deck with drinks and watching the boats go by. Can't wait for our next trip to Amsterdam and we will definitely choose to stay here again. Thank you so much Lydia

549310,91293703.0,8/4/2016,235376,Emmanuel,"Globalement très déçu par cette location.<br/>Les deux raisons principales sont:<br/>  1) Cet appartement est entouré d'une multitudes d'appartements (plus de 30) donnant tous sur la véranda et le jardin. Cela n'est pas du tout présenté dans la description de l'annonce. Les photos donne l'impression d'être isolé.<br/>  2) La chambre est en sous-sol, et une forte odeur d'humidité est présente ==> Nous n'avons pas pu dormir dans cette chambre et avons dormis au rez-de-chaussée. Nos enfants n'ont pas non plus dormis dans le cabanon extérieur pour les mêmes raison d'odeur.<br/><br/>Les points positifs:<br/>  1) La pièce principale est très agréable et bien équipée.<br/>  2) L'appartement est dans un quartier calme, proche du tramway.<br/><br/>En conclusion:<br/>Nous n'aurions jamais loué ce bien si on avait eu connaissance de l'environnement. De plus, l'odeur d'humidité dans les chambres pour nous ce n'était pas possible.<br/>"

549310,94424198.0,8/15/2016,22850318,Raka,"We had a lovely stay at Barbara's. <br/>The highlights : The kids room is a delight for any child. <br/>And the living room and kitchen are lovely, open with a nice garden. The kitchen is well stocked and you could prepare elaborate meals if you decided to!<br/>Very well located to the tram station making almost every place accessible within minutes.<br/><br/>We had Salima who was taking care of us and accessible easily for every query.<br/><br/>The only downside to note : Both the bedrooms lack proper ventilation (basement bedroom and the garden room). And hence tended to be damp/ humid, which was an issue for an overly sensitive (allergic) nose like mine.<br/><br/>But if this doesn't bother you/ your kids, then the place is delightful, especially for families with kids."

549310,222650152.0,12/30/2017,8190610,Lea,"Barbara's place is exactly as pictured. It was clean, spacious and the setup/decor made her home feel welcoming and comfortable. There was plenty of space for the 3 of us that were staying there. We especially loved her kitchen/living room area and washing machines (super easy to use). Barbara's place is of great value considering the space. Though not in Amsterdam Centraal, the tram was less than a 5 min walk from her place and you could get to the city center in about 15 mins. There are tons of shops & restaurants in the neighborhood to help you get everything you need to settle in. The only mishap was, we had agreed on a set time to arrive at Barbara's place (which was advised by Barbara after factoring in leaving the airport and traffic to her place). When we arrived I texted Victoria, the host who would be letting us into the house. I notified her that we were still on tract to meet at the agreed time with Barbara, however Victoria told me she would not be able to meet us until 2 hours after what was discussed with Barbara. I explained that the set time was based on our arrival at the airport and Barbara's suggestion. However Victoria tried to tell me I needed an additional hours to get through customs at the airport and that was the normal amount of time she needed to get through the airport and could not meet us any earlier because it would take her 2 hours to arrive at Barbara's place. We ended up waiting at the airport another 1 hour plus until we could meet Victoria. After a full day of traveling, it was a little frustrating considering the set time to meet was suggested by Barbara, so not sure where the miscommunication was with Victoria. Outside of this minor mishap, the rest of the check-in was smooth and we were able to fully enjoy our stay at Barbara's place. Would definitely stay here again."

549310,260005139.0,5/3/2018,23323663,Denis,"Очень хорошие апартаменты! Чувствовали себя как дома! <br/>Дом был полон всем чем нужно, было очень много продуктов, несколько бутылок вина, но мы из за своего воспитания не решились чем то воспользоваться, но я уверен что хозяин дома был бы не против))  Единственный минус это отопление, мы так и не смогли разобраться с настройками терморегулятора, он все время удерживал 20 градусов тепла,  при погоде на улице 12 градусов в доме было прохладно. Поэтому при заезде уточняйте у встречающего как настроить комфортную температуру!<br/>Расположение нормальное для туриста. До центра пешком 30 минут средним шагом. На автобусе минут 20.  В следующий раз обязательно буду арендовать именно эти апартаменты! Большое спасибо Барбара 😘"

Solo debo decir que los guardarropas estaban ocupados por completo con ropa de los huéspedes por lo cual no había lugar donde ubicar nuestra ropa."

Nous avons trouvé très facilement l'appartement ! <br/>Seuls petits points négatifs : nous n'avons jamais réussi à fermer correctement la porte de la baie-vitrée et Victoria n'a jamais répondu à notre SMS <br/>De plus, nous nous étions mis d'accord le premier jour sur une heure de check-out à 12h, et nous avons été prévenu la veille (minuit passée) que la maison était finalement relouée. Nous avons donc eu un peu l'impression de nous faire virer de la maison à la dernière minute car le lendemain matin à 10h toutes nos serviettes de bain étaient déjà en train de tourner dans la machine à laver.. <br/>Un peu dommage de finir sur cette impression, mais cette dernière ne nous retirera pas les supers moments que nous avons partagés dans la maison de Barbara !<br/><br/>P.S : attention pas de jacuzzi comme indiqué dans l'annonce et effectivement beaucoup de voisins donnent sur le jardin de la maison..."

Only a few minutes walk to Foodhallen. It was very easy to get to the centre by train or Uber. The house is tastefully furnished and our family of 6 had everything we needed to enjoy our stay in this home. Would highly recommend and if returning back to Amsterdam would book here again

The kitchen was fully equipped, the bathroom was clean and towels/soaps were provided. It's a nice and safe 15-20 minute walk to the city. Check-in was very easy and quick. We felt right at home immediately. I highly recommend Barbara's place!"

All questions got answered super fast.<br/><br/>Living room is spacious, beds comfortable and especially the kitchen is super large and practical.<br/><br/>The next station is 2 min from the door and you need about 10 min to the city center by tram.<br/><br/>The walls are quite thin so yes, super loud noise is not appropriate in Barbara's apartment.<br/><br/>All in all we had a great time and wish the host and her family the best."

L'unica piccola nota negativa è per la camera da letto che è nel piano interrato senza finestre. Tutto sommato il nostro soggiorno è stato positivo."

Our flight was canceled, so we would not be arriving until very late at night. He stayed up until we got to the apartment, so he could welcome us. We appreciated the hospitality, especially after difficult travel issues. It is located near active bars, but we had no issues sleeping."

Fica localizado em uma rua cheia de restaurantes, com bastante movimento, inclusive a noite, o que faz ser um pouco barulhento, mas não foi nenhum problema para nós. Edwin é super simpático e engraçado. Como é um quarto com banheiro compartilhado estávamos um pouco receosos quanto à limpeza do banheiro, mas Edwin limpava-o todos os dias e não tivemos problema nenhum. Ficamos muito satisfeitos e recomendamos muito o local."

Edwin was a great host, very responsive and welcoming, even helping with our luggage up the steep Dutch stairs. While the location is central and ideal we are glad we brought some ear plugs to drown out the noise from the street. Our private room was very comfortable and we did not run into too many issues with a shared bathroom."

Our first night was just amazing.  Edwin suggested that we must dine in this famouse Chinese restaurant which is 10 min away from his place. It was sooooo good. We will definitely stay again in his place next time we visit Amsterdam. Kisses to your fluffy super cute cat!

553514,3239979.0,1/3/2013,3525831,Julia,"We really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam, staying at Mirjam's place made it even more special and we felt really comfortable. As they live right on top, on the first floor, they were always there right away when we needed something. They are really open minded people, on request we even got an extra toaster and for New Year's Eve they came to let us try some of their selfmade Oliebollen (very delicious)!<br/>The apartment is within around 15 minutes walking to Anne Frank House or Dam Square. Bus and tram stops are right in front of the house."
553514,4070565.0,4/7/2013,5738915,Katja,We felt very welcomed at Mirjams place. She and her daughter gave us a lot of help and information which helped us having two very nice days in amsterdam. The place looks as nice as on the pictures and had enough space for two parents and two kids. 
553514,4255633.0,4/22/2013,953191,Wade,"Mirjam was very responsive with communication and flexible with check-in arrangements.  As a solo traveler, I booked a ""private room"" expecting that I might have hosts to interact with on my visit.  Regrettably, I never met Mirjam. The bed is a pull out couch just under the street facing window, so be prepared for the level of noise and comfort that provides."

553514,4716878.0,5/21/2013,3128966,Laura,"My friends and I spend a really good time in Amsterdam and in Mirjam's apartment. The flat is very clean and the hospitality excellent. The apartment is also not far from the city center 20 min walking and 10 minutes by bus and it is set in front of an amazing park with clubs where they play really good music. <br/><br/>"

Didi, who is the husband of Mirjam, was very helpful and prepared some foods for the next morning. The neighborhood from there is also nice, especially the Belgian Bar right next corner of the next building was stronly recommended as well. Definitely want to stay next time again!!! "
794322,32826022.0,5/22/2015,14397946,Fletcher,What an incredibly unique and fun way to experience an insight into the local Amsterdam house boat lifestyle. Very comfortable with everything you need. Lydia is very friendly and helpful. Perfectly located with a nice market across the bridge and everything within a short cycle distance. Highly recommended!!
794322,33059073.0,5/25/2015,15183864,Carsten,Great place. We definitely enjoyed the stay.
794322,33656941.0,5/31/2015,17258118,Dana And Henry,"Lydia was very welcoming and friendly and explained everything we needed to know. The boat is gorgeous, better even than the picutres, and in a great location. It feels very quiet however you are just a few minutes from the red light and the busy centre. Very comfortable and big bed which was a bonus for us. I would really recommend staying here, we had a great time. "
794322,34172081.0,6/5/2015,22864890,Christina,"The houseboat is amazing! The location is PERFECT. Couldn't ask for a more. I could have used an air conditioner, but I like to sleep in the extra cold. Lydia was amazing! She was out of town but her friend came and answered everything and showed us around. Sitting on the deck was a perfect way to people watch and relax after a long day, or even during the day. <br/><br/>The only thing I could possibly say negative would be if you have allergies just know it is under a tree and the doors are open. My boyfriend had a hard time sleeping because of his allergies. But even he said he was glad we stayed there despite the allergies. <br/><br/>If you have a chance to stay, please do it! "
794322,34282835.0,6/7/2015,28938799,Jenni,"Our experience on The Flying Pig was absolutely amazing. Lydia had left wine, bread, crisps, ham and cheese to welcome us, and the beautiful finishing touches around the boat just rounded everything off perfectly. <br/><br/>We spent a lot of time enjoying the sunshine on the deck watching the world go by listening to the street musicians ... The area is brilliant, very chic with quirky boutique shops and off the beaten track bars and restaurants. You are right in the middle of it all on The Flying Pig with main attractions such as Dam Square and the infamous Red Light District only a 5-10 minute walk away.<br/><br/>Myself and my husband would highly recommend staying here - drinking Prosecco on the deck we were the envy of everyone. Great area, fabulous boat, brilliant host what more could you ask for ?  "

If you are visiting Amsterdam and want a romantic, picturesque experience, then look no further as you have found the perfect accommodation! <br/><br/>Lydia's boat is approximately a 15 minute walk from Central Station and in easy walking distance from all the major areas, bars, restaurants and supermarkets.<br/><br/>When we arrived there was a bottle of red wine and two glasses waiting on the table,some food in the fridge and fresh fruit on the side. As Lydia was working the morning we arrived, a friend was waiting with the keys but Lydia was in communication by text from the moment we landed.<br/><br/>As we arrived early and left late in the afternoon, Lydia was very flexible and accommodating on check-in and check-out times as there were no guests checking out when we arrived and the next visitors were not checking in until the next day. This was so helpful to us and was hugely appreciated.<br/><br/>The boat itself was clean and tidy as was the bathroom. I was worried about getting a little seasick but it was stable and moved very little. In addition, there was always hot water and electricity.<br/><br/>The whole experience was 10 out of 10 and we will definitely be staying again!<br/><br/>Wayne and Jason"
794322,36196312.0,6/26/2015,32481994,Lisa,"Meine Schwester und ich haben uns auf Lydias Hausboot sehr wohl gefühlt. Leider haben wir Lydia nicht persönlich getroffen, aber ihr Nachbar hat uns stattdessen empfangen und uns alle Fragen rund um das Hausboot beantwortet. Lydia hatte uns den Kühlschrank mit Brot, Wein, Saft und Käse gefüllt und sich per SMS erkundigt, ob alles gut läuft. Das Boot sah genauso aus wie auf den Bildern und die Umgebung war einfach unschlagbar. Wir konnten alles zu Fuß erreichen und haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt. Ich würde das Hausboot jederzeit wieder mieten! "
794322,36375411.0,6/28/2015,25635348,Paul,"Lydia was very friendly and helpful as was her neighbour Bernie who welcomed us and gave us the mini tour.<br/><br/>The houseboat was fine for a weekend stay. It was as described in a perfect, peaceful spot with lots of passing boats as we were able to sit on the mini deck drinking our breakfast coffee with the local cat saying hello each morning.<br/><br/>The main picture on Airbnb is deceptive as the place is not quite as big or pristine as we had hoped - however it was as I say functional and comfortable as a well located base to explore the beautiful city of Amsterdam and all its varied sights and sounds.<br/><br/>People were naturally and genuinely friendly and helpful, all speaking very good English.<br/><br/>The great breakfast at Firenze's ? on the corner was a delicious bonus as was the food and wine left by our host on our arrival."

Lydia was even very kind leaving us some snacks and wine which we very much enjoyed! We are both over 6 foot and found the boat very comfortable and spacious. No problems with bumping heads or fitting in the bed space. Boat is also in a good spot to walk around the city from. Loved it! Thank you.

The location was perfect, right across the ""street"" (canal) from a big street fair, restaurants and stores right on the block, and yet we found it quiet and peaceful. Lydia was kind and helpful and even left us some goodies in the fridge upon our arrival. We slept like babies in the cozy bow of the boat, with the occasional gentle rocking, and the canal ""traffic"" when you were up on deck were all friendly and fun. What struck me most about the houseboat was how nice it was to never feel alone and yet once you were inside, there was complete privacy. We had a great time in Amsterdam thanks to Lydia."

794322,43907751.0,8/23/2015,31382020,Lisa,We have just returned from our minimoon on Lydia's boat and we have had a fantastic weekend. The boat is lovely and in a perfect location only 10 min walk from Dam square. We did buy a hop on hop off ticket but to be honest it was easier and quicker to walk. We were lucky to book during the same weekend as the Amsterdam Sail event which meant that lounging around on the deck in the sun was even more enjoyable as we had all the boats sailing past. The boat is situated on one of the busier canals but slightly away from the loud bars so sleep is not affected. Lydia is lovely and is was on hand if we needed her. There is everything you need on board for a comfortable stay and if you are planning on visiting Amsterdam I would highly recommend this boat to stay on. We will be booking again.

794322,47632353.0,9/21/2015,29657146,Cindy,Fantastic experience in her lovely boat.  We felt like at home.  Lydia is very nice and sympatic she welcomed us personally and let's us leaving our luggage in the morning when we arrived. Then she was available for any of our questions to find nice place to go or to eat. She left also a bottle of wine to welcome us in the boat.  We were about 10mn walk of everything. I recommand it to discover this lovely city of Amsterdam
794322,48014479.0,9/22/2015,42994812,Craig,"We had such a lovely stay on Lydia's boat. My partner was a little overwhelmed at first at how charming and idyllic it was. The location is perfect, right in the heart of the city but far enough out the way to ensure a quiet nights sleep. The boat had everything you needed in terms of mod-cons. I'm so glad we booked it."
794322,48504168.0,9/27/2015,35497510,Sophie,Great place to stay had a wonderful time Lyidia was a lovely welcoming person house boat was lovely and in a great location and would love to go back 
794322,49027018.0,9/30/2015,9409709,Katie,"Amsterdam - we love you!! This cute houseboat made our experience all the more amazing. Lydia left us some nice treats and we were able to check in a little later easily with the help of her kind neighbor. The location was perfect. We were a quick walk from everything, yet just far enough away that the nights were quiet and cozy. Several of our friends are looking to travel to Amsterdam, and we have already recommended this cozy home without a second thought!"
794322,49973397.0,10/8/2015,29583813,Julian,"LOVED IT!! You can't stay in Amsterdam without experiencing a houseboat, and this one was PERFECT!!! The two seats above on the deck are the BEST! You wake up in the morning, drink your coffee and eat your croissant, and you feel like your in heaven. The best view. Didn't even feel the boat moving inside. Definitely recommend staying here when you come to Amsterdam. It's located perfectly in the center! Thanks again Lydia!!"
794322,50480361.0,10/12/2015,43377313,Richard,"Fantastic experience. The houseboat is in a brilliant location, which is near to everything, but is quite. Lydia is very friendly, helpful and makes you feel welcome. The boat itself is really nice and has everything you need."
794322,51113088.0,10/18/2015,36972162,Craig,My wife and I stayed here last week and are so glad we did. Lydia was very welcoming and understanding as our original flight was cancelled and we arrived much later than expected. She had bought in some shopping for us which was very much appreciated. The boat is beautiful and comfortable with everything you would need easily to hand. The location is also a big plus as it's very central. You would expect it to be noisy because of this but it isn't at all. Highly recommended!
794322,51562682.0,10/21/2015,17749667,Attila,"Lidya nagyon kedves és figyelmes házigazda volt. Bár csak két személyre hirdeti a lakóhajót, kérésünkre lehetövé tette, hogy gyermekünkkel együtt száljunk meg ezen a fantasztikusan romantikus szálláson. A hütöszekrényben sok finomság várt, bár erre nem is gondoltunk a foglalásnál. A hajó a lehetö legtökéletesebb helyen van, minden könnyen elérhetö gyalog, tömegközlekedéssel, vagy biciklivel. Mindenkinek csak ajánlani tudjuk, aki szereti a nem szokványos, romantikus, klassz dolgokat.  "
794322,52222772.0,10/27/2015,28152696,Emanuele,Amazing and romantic place to stay in Amsterdam perfect to surprise your other half. Lydia gave us a little treat. Bottle of red wine and flower to start Amazing!! We will be back definitely<br/>Emanuele 
794322,52693824.0,11/1/2015,12129206,Mariah,Lydia's houseboat is ideally situated for exploring all that Amsterdam has to offer! It is extremely cozy and convenient to everything. We had a great stay!
794322,53125228.0,11/5/2015,35000674,Sue,"We had a lovely stay on the Houseboat. Lydia met us and was so welcoming and friendly.  She had left us lots of goodies in the fridge, and a lovely bottle of wine, which was so welcome with our late arrival.  The candles were lit, making the place so inviting.  The heating was very effective, the place was toasty warm for our whole stay.  The boat is in such a great location, a fantastic market across the canal to explore and we enjoyed the most delicious thai meal at a restaurant around the corner from the boat.  We would recommend the houseboat to all our friends, and we hope to stay there again in the future.  Thank you Lydia for making our anniversary trip so special - it was lovely to meet you! "

794322,54589260.0,11/22/2015,45051404,Valery,We had a wonderful stay in Lydia's boathouse. She was the perfect host and greeted us right outside. She gave us some good suggestions on where to go eat and hangout with the locals. The place was clean and had the perfect location (everything was within a 20 minute walk and the city centre was within 10 minutes). We didn't feel the boat rock at all and the lighting from the sky light made the place even more magical. The canal where the boat is located is absolutely stunning and we even got to see some swans swim by our window one morning. Would absolutely recommend to anyone who wants to have a wonderful stay in Amsterdam.
794322,55035328.0,11/27/2015,41909104,Cristina,"Lydia is the best host that I've ever meet. She is nice and open and have a briliand good mood and a huge smile. She waited me with the boat heated as I ask because I just got a flu.<br/>The boat is exactly in sentrum, very cosy and have a delightful old wood smell. Very cean and cozy.<br/>Lydia wait for us with some wine, juice, fruits and something for sandwiches.<br/>Was first time for me in a boat but I don't regret at all. I hope I will come back soon and for sure I will live on the same place during my holiday."
553514,7164699.0,9/9/2013,7899937,Lia,"Prima appartement op leuke locatie (vlak bij Westerpark). Leuk dat je ook even buiten in de tuin of gewoon op het bankje voor het huis kan zitten. Vriendelijke gastvrije ontvangst, we ( 2 dochters en ik) konden er zelfs voor één nacht boeken en dat lukt niet makkelijk in Amsterdam. <br/>Hier en daar een spinnewebje en ook de gaspit was niet helemaal schoon, maar dat mocht de pret niet drukken. Ik kan het iedereen aanbevelen."
553514,7340745.0,9/16/2013,8356797,Mariana,We had a very nice time at Mirjam's. The apartment is located at a very nice part of the city and at a walking distance of the city center. It is very cozy and perfect for a small family. Mirjam and Didi were really nice and helpful. 
553514,7532146.0,9/23/2013,8781003,Dishant,"It was a nice room. Although the sofa beds were a bit small for us, but still we enjoyed the stay. Mirjam is a very nice person. She was very helpful and her information about how to reach the place, all the local pubs, restaurants and the places to see helped us a lot. Overall it was a very nice experience. And plus, there's a fantastic burger place just 10 steps away from her house where we had one of the finest chicken burgers! :D"
553514,7852027.0,10/6/2013,8496158,Falk,"We spent two great days in amsterdam, bought a real omafiets an had a cosy night in mirjams flat. Mirjam and Didi were very friendly hosts and gave us advice for bicycle-shops. Thanks a lot. Greetings from Falk"
553514,8802390.0,11/18/2013,5025198,Maryline,"Mirjam est une hôte accueillante  et très sympathique , très souple sur les horaires d'arrivée et de départ . L'appartement agréable et fonctionnel, convient à une famille de 4 ,  il est situé dans un quartier très calme à l'ouest d'Amsterdam où il est  facile de garer la voiture .Le  départ du tram est dans la rue  ce qui permet d'atteindre rapidement le centre en  10 min   ,le trajet peut également se faire  à pieds   , les quartiers traversés jusqu'au centre étant   très agréables pour marcher  . Une adresse à retenir pour un nouveau séjour."
553514,10270178.0,2/10/2014,1994525,Lisa,"This apartment was perfect for my stay in Amsterdam -- I especially liked the immediate access to the 10 Tram and 21 Bus just a few steps from the front door.<br/><br/>Mirjam was a fantastic host; she was communicative and available if I needed anything--whether it be tips on what to do or if I needed help calling a taxi. The apartment is perfectly set up with Amsterdam guidebooks, tram booklet, and museum pamphlets, which was a really nice touch. There are also books and DVDs that make it feel like home.<br/><br/>The WiFi worked really well, which was also great for being able to get work done.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is safe and primarily residential; though there are definitely grocery stores and small eateries/bakeries within a 5 minute walk. As a single female traveler, I never felt unsafe being outside in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>In my opinion this apartment is best just for 1 person- (or 1 adult + 1 child). If my boyfriend had been with me, we would not have been able to comfortably share the futon bed due to its size (though it's possible the second  couch in the room can be made into a bed).<br/><br/>And, random advice, I wish I would have brought rubber sandals to wear in the apartment. The bathroom is a combination where the shower water makes the entire floor of the bathroom wet (by design), so sandals would be nice so my feet stay dry if I needed the bathroom again.<br/><br/>This is a great, clean apartment, and I would definitely stay here again if I'm traveling in Amsterdam alone."
553514,10707182.0,3/3/2014,11480399,Julie,"L'appartement correspond en tous points aux photos et à la description du site. Il est idéalement situé, dans un quartier très agréable. Il est adapté pour une famille (avec deux enfants dans notre cas). Mirjam est enfin une hôte particulièrement accueillante, qui nous a donné tous les conseils nécessaires à un super séjour. La flexibilité quant aux horaires de départ et d'arrivée est un vrai confort. A recommander sans hésiter !"

Edwin is incredibly friendly, and we felt very welcome in his home. Only thing is you absolutely have to be able to get up and down stairs which were no problem for us. Overall, incredible stay. We preferred it so much to staying in a hotel."

I found Mirjam very friendly & responsive in communications; unfortunately didn't get to meet her.  Didi her husband was nice and showed me around the apartment.  I was there in early March, cold and cloudy - it was cold in the apartment and the gas stove did not help much in warming things up.  Didi mentioned they are getting central heating very soon, will be a good addition!<br/><br/>The neighborhood is nice, especially recommend going up to the Westergasfabriek park; nice cafes and restaurant/pubs (get a beer at Westerliefde), don't miss the Espresso Fabriek (great coffee) and De Bakkerswinkel (great baked goods, sandwiches and music/atmosphere)!<br/>"

(exactly like in the photos :-)<br/>We were 4 people in the room  and use the kitchen to cook as well.<br/>It's also so pleasant to sit and chill out in the special garden (we loved the huge tree!),<br/> The neighborhood is fun to explore and the public transportation close by (tram 10 & bus 21) is very comfortable with a great access.<br/>Didi was a super kind host and the energy in the house is very peaceful.  Unfortunately we haven't met Mirjam and that's a good excuse to come again soon!"

It was so convenient to get the tram right into the centre, and we also love the fact it was on the ground floor and had no stairs to climb with heavy cases etc.  Mirjam and Didi were delightful, so helpful and the perfect hosts, making sure that everything was OK for us, giving us lots of useful information on places to eat.  Thank You!!  Lorna"
553514,11836575.0,4/16/2014,3736982,Michelle,"We recently spent 3 nights at Mirjam's and Didi's place and what a wonderful experience it was. They were very accommodating to the family and even made sure our 11 month old daughter had a place to sleep. The location is fantastic, steps away from the train and bus line. We highly recommend a walk through the beautiful Westerpark which was a 5 min walk away from the apartment. Thank you Mirjam and Didi for being so helpful in our first visit to Amsterdam, we will be sure to look you up when we return."

The location is perfect, a short walk to any central location with lots of nice cafes and interesting shops in the area. Staying aboard the boat made our trip to Amsterdam really special. We were warm and snug despite the cold weather outside and it was a lovely early Christmas present for us both. "
794322,57921002.0,12/30/2015,49283694,Kate,"What better way to experience Amsterdam than staying in the heart of the city staying on this beautiful houseboat. The location couldn't be better, within walking distance of everything Amsterdam has to offer, but still on a quiet part of canal, best of both worlds in my opinion. The boat is everything we expected, cute, quirky and perfect for a short break. We were greeted by Lydia on arrival, she told us everything we needed to know about the boat and the local amenities. thank you Lydia for having us."

We loved coming back to the boat - it was our sanctuary. <br/>Lydia had left us with a fridge full of Dutch snacks and a bottle of champagne. It was the perfect start to being in Amsterdam.<br/>The heater keeps the place at a comfortable temp and the water pressure in the bathroom is strong and hot! <br/>We were also invited to enjoy the New Years fireworks from the rooftop next door which was the most amazing part of our entire trip. <br/>Needless to say whenever I come back to Amsterdam I HAVE to stay here. I feel like this place was more part of our vacation than anything else. It has character and is very romantic. We loved every second here and can't wait to come back. <br/>"

The house boat experience was really, really great -- it's a cozy studio apartment right in the heart of Amsterdam and staying on the boat was a fantastic bonus to an already lovely trip. I'd recommend it to any folks who want a different (/authentic?) experience when visiting the city."

It was very cute, there was a bottle of wine and some food for us which was very much appreciated and it was always warm. I would definitely recommend staying here as it is centrally located and so close to everything yet the street is lovely and quiet. I would stay here again if we are lucky enough to return to Amsterdam, my partner and I loved that it was completely different from anything we've stayed in before and felt like we were really experiencing Amsterdam rather than just staying in a corporate hotel.

28871,362410636.0,12/26/2018,38346818,Maddie,"Truly the best location you could find, especially for the great value. Two towels per guest, free access to laundry with detergent, convenient bathroom, and quite literally the best hospitality from Edwin I could expect and more. The stairs up to the rooms are QUITE STEEP -- if you have mobility problems, don't stay here. Also, don't plan on being able to use the wifi to stream shows or do  a lot of web surfing, but there's enough power to facetime for a minute and to message/use your Maps app. Not a big deal, because why are you using your phone when you're traveling abroad?! A+++ for Edwin and his kitty!"

794322,66700153.0,3/24/2016,6359623,Melania,"Lydia is a great host! She makes sure you have some nibbles and a drink so you aren't stuck with nothing to snack on or drink when there. She was very kind and attentive when we contacted her for help.<br/><br/>The boat is very cozy and stays surprisingly warm with the gas heater. We accidentally turned it off and Lydia was there to help us turn it back on so we didn't freeze. Late March and it was still cold, but that boat was always toasty. <br/><br/>There's a stove, a fridge, a toilet,  a shower, and a couch. That's really all you need :)<br/><br/>The location was pretty good too, right across from the Opera/Ballet house which always has a taxi stand. Cafes right outside your door almost and only about 15-20 min to walk to Central Station and 10 min to Red Light District. There's a supermarket about 7-10 min and plenty of restaurants near that too.<br/><br/>A unique experience when visiting Amsterdam!"
794322,66908390.0,3/25/2016,58621931,Lexi,"Lydia was a fantastic host, as she is quick to answer. She was at the house upon arrival and welcomed us immediately into her house with a bottle of wine and snacks. The neighborhood was exactly how it looked in the pictures and the listing was accurate. Lydia's boat was a cute place to stay, I loved everything about it and the bed was extremely comfortable. I highly recommend staying here and with Lydia. "
794322,67123673.0,3/27/2016,47109855,Laurette,"Nous avons été très bien accueilli par Lydia ! <br/>Dormir sur la péniche a rendu notre week-end encore plus authentique.<br/>Situé en plein centre, on a tout fait à pied.<br/>Je le recommande."

For a hundred year old boat it was very clean and homely! Lydia was a great host, very friendly and accommodating, certainly willing to make sure our stay was perfect. The location was great, it definitely made getting around the city easy.<br/>Would certainly stay again and recommend to anyone looking to stay somewhere a little different whilst in Amsterdam."

794322,69952999.0,4/15/2016,14672989,Marielle,"Vi følte oss veldig velkommen når vi ankom Lydias husbåt. Hun var svært imøtekommende og trivelig, og det veide opp med at vi ikke klarte å komme i kontakt med henne før avreise til Amsterdam. (Hun hadde visst fått stjålet telefon og pc). <br/>Husbåten var akkurat like sjarmerende som beskrivelsen og nabolaget var helt suverent. Det var stille og rolig, men likevel så sentralt at det kun var snakk om å gå noen minutter for å komme til sentrale steder i Amsterdam. <br/>Absolutt verdt et besøk i husbåten til Lydia. Det var rent og pent og ekstremt sjarmerende å sitte på taket og drikke kaffe mens turistene tøffet forbi på turistbåtene. "
794322,71567170.0,4/26/2016,5331179,Samantha,"Lydia's boathouse was an amazing experience! Me and my husband really enjoyed it and would love to recommend it to anyone who wants to experience living on a boat. Thank you for everything, Lydia! :)"
794322,72443512.0,5/2/2016,49002842,Paul,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful 4 nights on Lydia's houseboat. The boat is in a great location for getting to all of Amsterdam's highlights. Lydia was very welcoming, and also very understanding when our flight was cancelled, and we arrived later than planned. Despite it's central location, and proximity to some of the lively nightspots, it was very peaceful at night, and we slept very well on the climb-in bed. The boat had everything we needed, was clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. The small area on the outside deck is ideal for a spot of breakfast, or maybe a a drink or two before heading out for the evening. We would certainly recommend it."
794322,72771282.0,5/4/2016,63469761,Ben,"Lydia was a great host a big smiley face on arrival and the flat has everything you need for a little break. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else when I go back to Amsterdam, would recommend highly! "
553514,14026780.0,6/10/2014,10106309,Audrey,l'appartement est bien situé à l'ouest d'Amsterdam avec un bus direct de la gare Central station. nous n'avons malheureusement pas rencontré Mirjam mais elle a été présente dès que nous avons eu des questions. L'appartement était de petite taille mais suffisant pour 4 pour un court séjour. Le jardin est agréable sous le soleil!
553514,14164937.0,6/13/2014,8554270,Mikaela,"I visited Amsterdam June 2014 with two friends and we decided to stay at Mirjam's lovely flat. From the start Mirjam was an incredible host, answering all of my questions within minutes (truly!) She and her husband Didi take great care of their property and all of the guests who stay there. They personally broke down all the events going on in the area and helped us with numerous logistical questions. The flat is exactly as advertised and in a fantastic location by tram and bus lines and easy walking distance to many of Amsterdam's sites. I cannot recommend Mirjam and her flat enough!"
553514,14277867.0,6/16/2014,3707140,Julian,"Mirjam et Didi ont été des hôtes très gentils et prévenants : malgré notre arrivée tardive due à des bouchons, ils nous ont attendus et acceuilli à bras ouverts dans l'appartement, avec en prime un bouquet de tulpes et une bouteille de vin. Je recommande chaudement ce lieu plaisant, proche du centre historique d'amsterdam et d'un petit parc très sympathique!"
553514,14683668.0,6/24/2014,13404927,Harald,"Mirjam und Didi sind hervorragende Gastgeber, die stets hilfsbereit und freundlich sind. Auch während der normalen Arbeitszeit haben sie alles getan, um zB unser Auto irgendwo anders zu parken (wo es kostenlos ist), ein Babybett zur Verfügung gestellt oder unsere Wäsche gewaschen. Das Viertel ist sehr angenehm zu wohnen, direkt vor der Haustüre fährt die Straßenbahn 10 in die Stadt, es gibt keine Touristenströme, dafür aber ganz normales Leben. Nicht zu vergessen der Westerpark, der viel weniger überlaufen ist als der Vondelpark. Mit dem Fahrrad ist man in 5-10min im Grachtenviertel oder im Jordaan. Das Apartment ist bis zu 3 Personen gut geeignet, es sieht auf den Bildern etwas größer aus, als es tatsächlich ist. Alles in allem haben wir es nicht bereut, dort eine Woche verbracht zu haben!"
553514,15119475.0,7/2/2014,8683361,Simon&Julie,"Our stay in Amsterdam was very very nice, a lot because of this appartment. The peaceful spirit of the place put us in a very good mood for our trip. It's cool and located close to a big park. Good point for the backyard garden, small but very tiny. Thanks to Mirjam for being a good host, she was helpful and her french was good too! I totally recommend the place. Last point, just a little bit small to host four people, but when you well know your friends, no problem!"
553514,15313296.0,7/7/2014,8449873,Virginie,"Mirjam et Didi ont été des hôtes très accueillants et prévenants! Le logement était agréable et chaleureux. De plus, il se situe près du Westerpark et du quartier Jordaan, de beaux coins dans lesquels se promener et flâner. Un très grand merci !"
553514,15757753.0,7/15/2014,15364892,Julia,"Das Apartment ist sehr liebevoll eingerichtet und gemütlich. In dem kleinen Garten kann man entspannt sitzen und z.B. frühstücken. Für drei Erwachsene passte der Platz genau. Die Lage ist sehr zentral (10 Minuten mitBus und Bahn zum HBF und Innenstadt)und auch die direkt Umgebung ist sehr schön. (Geschäfte, Park etc.) Von dem Apartment kann ziemlich entspannt Spaziergänge machen."

553514,17282759.0,8/10/2014,17117004,Rico,Our stay with Mirjam was great. She and her husband were very kind (there was even a bottle of wine waiting for us in the apartment) and the appartment is beautiful. It's nicely decorated and the location is perfect being so close to the Jordaan and the Westerpark. We slept on comfortable sleeping couches and didn't even use the nice garden. Mirjam gave us some usefull tips on what the neighbourhood has got to offer as well. It was a great experience.

They were very friendly and helped us by giving us information about the city. <br/>We appreciated their help in buying us tickets for the Anne Frank house.<br/>The apartment is comfortable and well located. It is easy to arrive at the center of the city. We hope to come back one day."
553514,18798490.0,9/1/2014,9447573,Edgars,"С хозяйкой мы, к сожалению, не познакомились. Зато нас встретила очень приятная молодая девушка - её дочь, а провожал муж хозяйки, тоже очень приятный человек. Мы (3 человека) оставались всего на одну ночь. Месторасположение очень понравилось - в 10 минутах ходьбы от центра, тихий и спокойный район. Поблизости остановки общественного транспорта, магазины, кафе-рестораны, кофешопы. <br/>Обстановка соответствует фотографиям, но я ожидал немного большего. В квартире есть абсолютно все, что может понадобиться туристу.<br/>Комната находится на первом этаже, поэтому хорошо было слышно как ходили люди на втором этаже, но спать это не мешало. Ночью все было тихо и спокойно.<br/>Приятным сюрпризом была бутылка хорошего Розе, ожидающая нас на столе. Так же было очень приятно, что хозяева позволили оставить вещи до вечера.<br/><br/>"

Edwin was a great hostess even if he wasn’t in the house. He was very helpful. His cat is gorgeous, she gave us a quick visit during the mornings 😊. Small room, tight stairs but location is amazing."
28871,403041127.0,1/20/2019,27453804,Melissa,Everything was fine! Its a cool and cosy place and also very central - because of that it is a bit noisy at night but it didn't bother us much and we could sleep well.

However I gave it 4 out if 5 as our overall experience was that the noise was sometimes excessive and went on till 4 in the morning. <br/><br/>Tea and coffee nice touch.<br/><br/>Edwin was a super  host and went out of his way to help us out.   <br/><br/>Highly recommended.

Edwin was an excellent host -- very nice, friendly, and funny as hell. The stairs were not too bad; we climbed steeper steps in Cuba. The bathroom is shared but was always super clean. There is some street noise from the club and bars down the street, but I slept with earplugs just fine (I'm a super light sleeper). The location CANNOT be beat. It's a few minutes walk to ANYWHERE in central Amsterdam; less than 5 min walk to multiple tram lines. We can't wait to come back to Amsterdam and we'll definitely see if this room is available again-- we would book again for sure! Thanks for the best place to crash in all of Amsterdam, Edwin!"

28871,430818383.0,3/31/2019,44191189,Juan Carlos,"La casa está muy bien situada. Está en una calle de zona de marcha, con bares y restaurantes. Por la noches hay mucho jaleo y el ruido de la música y las voces se dejan sentir. Si estás acostumbrado a dormir sin ninguno ruido, no podrás pegar ojo hasta las 3am que es cuando cierran los bares. Luego completo silencio. Cómo nosotros llegábamos rendidos a la habitación de patear la ciudad, no nos enteramos del ruido. La cama es muy cómoda y la habitación bien caliente. El baño es compartido, es pequeño pero siempre limpio y sin olores desagradables."
28871,432254553.0,4/3/2019,13904539,Meagan,"Edwin's Guesthouse is centrally located, clean, transit accessible, and within walking distance of so many shops, restaurants, etc. - a great home base for exploring. And Edwin is a great host, very responsive to my questions and honest up front about the noise in the area (Nb I just brought ear plugs, and was fine to sleep). He had suggestions on where to see heaps of seasonal flowers, and the transit directions he provided to his place were clear. Do note steep and narrow stairs to the rooms from the main entrance."
28871,435018902.0,4/9/2019,59432165,Nicola,"Abbiamo soggiornato da Edwin 3 notti. È un ragazzo molto disponibile e non perde l’occasione per dare un consiglio e rendersi utile. La stanza è in un’ottima posizione, comoda per muoversi in qualsiasi direzione. Si trova in una via laterale del bloemenmarket, vicino a tutti i punti di interesse, a 20 minuti a piedi dalla stazione centrale. Noi ce la siamo girata tutta a piedi ma volendo è comodo anche noleggiare una bicicletta. Se dovessimo tornare ad Amsterdam sicuramente ricontatteremmo Edwin. L’unica cosa che consiglio sono i tappi per le orecchie :) essendo una posizione molto centrale nel week è un po’ caotica. A presto Edwin 😁 grazie di tutto!!!"

Would recommend without hesitation, Lydia is a lovely and welcoming host and the boat is exactly like the pictures. Only a ten minute walk from Dam Square, the area is quiet in the evenings and is a perfect base for exploring the city. A true home from home, the boat retains all its' historic and authentic features. Sitting on deck watching the world go by made our holiday unforgettable. Thank you Lydia! "
794322,73901267.0,5/11/2016,43633757,Stephanie,My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay. I mean how can you go wrong on a picture-esk houseboat in the middle of Amsterdam! We were greeted by Lydia's neighbor Berny who supplied us the keys and gave us a brief run down of what was near us. The boat was on a part of the canal that wasn't too busy or noisy. The small seating area outside was perfect during the day or night to take in the city. Lydia clearly takes great care of her houseboat and made it feel like home to us. 
28871,435740495.0,4/11/2019,101780564,Grant,"Can’t get a better location. Heaps on your front door step and even more within a 5 minute walk. Very easy to get to from the centraal station as the tram drops you off down the end of the street.<br/>Really cool coffee shops on the street too, very chilled.<br/>Edwin is funny and very helpful and keeps the place pretty clean. <br/>Not your own bathroom but really who cares, room is private and lockable.<br/>Great value for money!"

28871,452550686.0,5/13/2019,159753270,María José,"Esta casa esta en pleno centro, al lado del tranvía y comercio... Muy cerca de todo para ir caminando. La habitación es lo que muestran las fotos, un lugar cómodo y limpio. Está ubicado en un barrio bohemio con un poco de ruido por los restorants y pubs pero no impide dormir por la noche, con unos tapones es suficiente. <br/>Volvería sin duda a casa de Edwin."
28871,453593126.0,5/16/2019,2618971,Sally,You get what you pay for here...Amsterdam is very pricey. Edwin is a great host and super sweet. If you just want a place to crash and don’t mind a pretty busy neighborhood that is noisy all night then go for it. I am a terrible sleeper so it was not for me. Also others mention the steep stairs...if that’s at all an issue because you have a big piece of luggage or have climbing issues this is something to be mindful of.
28871,457030797.0,5/23/2019,42683358,Lucie,We could not recommend Edwin's place more. It was everything we needed for a few days in Amsterdam. It was also really clean and right in the centre of the city. Edwin is really welcoming and has lots of great tips. Thanks for being such a wonderful host!
28871,458647676.0,5/26/2019,74145592,Jessica,"Absolutely perfect. Best location to explore Amsterdam by foot. We barely left the neighborhood and we saw so much! Would definitely stay again. Only negative is how loud it could be at night, recommend a couple Advil PM for this place (;"
28871,461287286.0,5/31/2019,23423896,Lou,Edwin was a wonderful host with the most amazing apartment in the heart of it all. Everything was walking distance.

We loved his personality - he’s funny, very welcoming and vibrant, just like a good friend! <br/><br/>The room was very comfortable and spacious enough to open two big luggages at the same time. The bathroom was clean. Teas and coffee were provided and we loved a big cup of hot tea after a long day visit!!!!"
28871,464317752.0,6/5/2019,154121406,Facundo Javier,"Edwin es muy buen anfitrión. Siempre está atento a los mensajes. Su alojamiento tiene varios puntos a favor: la habitación (me alojé en la doble con mi novia) es muy amplia y la cama es súper cómoda, el baño está excelente (buena presión de ducha y temperatura del agua), y la ubicación es bastante buena (está a metros del imperdible Flowers Markets y tiene bares y restaurantes muy cerca). Pese a ser compartido, no tuvimos problemas para el uso del baño. Había una chica en la habitación de al lado y una pareja en la de arriba. Un aspecto a mejorar es el Wifi, que funciona muy mal. En conclusión, nos fuimos muy conformes y volveríamos a elegirlo en un posible futuro viaje a Ámsterdam."
28871,465674448.0,6/8/2019,13591814,Katelyn,"Edwin was so friendly and happy to help, full of local tips. Great location, with Amsterdam at your doorstep. Highly recommend. You actually do not feel as though you are in Edwins apartment either as you enter the house and continue up a set of stairs straight to your room (with a second rented room across the way) and the bathroom is right outside your room. Good setup."
28871,471236786.0,6/17/2019,209519318,Christine,My sister and I had an amazing trip to Amsterdam. We can’t thank Edwin enough for everything! He is truly amazing and super friendly. Amazing location— close to everything and anything. The bed we slept in was super comfortable.

Close to great nightlife, parks, great food, even better drink, and just everything you want. Bed is comfortable, towels were provided for showering. Simply. Perfect."

Our room and bathroom were spotless, and Edwin went out of his way to help us with luggage, check-in and provided us with recommendations. Thankyou, we can’t wait to come back!"
28871,482243223.0,7/6/2019,122347860,Jessica,We enjoyed our stay at Edwins place. Was a perfect neighborhood to be in close to everything Amsterdam has to offer. Street noise is there on a Friday and Saturday but with a fan and the window closed you barely notice it. Would stay here again if in Amsterdam.
28871,484203016.0,7/8/2019,225643159,Kelcione,"Edward foi super atencioso, sempre respondida as mensagens com minhas dúvidas; a localização é maravilhosa, o quarto e o banheiro são  limpos e organizados. Adorei e recomendo. Voltarei com certeza."

794322,75311015.0,5/20/2016,17241781,Callum,Lovely quaint boat in the centre of Amsterdam. Very warm with great central heating and lots of water pressure too! One thing to note is that the boat is split into 2 apartments and not 1.
794322,75914889.0,5/23/2016,13175654,Christian,"we had a nice time on lydias boat.the location is great.good communication and good parking tips.thanks,tatjana and christian<br/>"
794322,77265244.0,5/31/2016,72078910,Jessy,"Lydia was a lovely host, the previous guests left early so she let us check in earlier, which was just what we needed landing early that morning. The boat was just how I pictured it, we sat and ate breakfast outside the boat each morning and watched other boats and people go by, a great way to start each day. The only place to stay in Amsterdam! It's perfectly located with a supermarket just a 5 minute walk away and lots of shops and restaurants near by. We decided to get bikes, which is a must only took us 10mins to get anywhere we wanted, so much fun and a lot quicker than walking. Defiantly want to come back in the future. Thank you Lydia!"
794322,80376809.0,6/17/2016,67329455,Dave,"From the second I got there until the second I left everything was better than I imagined. The perfect neighborhood and an amazing  boat, just right for singles or couples.<br/>Although I did not meet Lydia, her friend greeted me with a nice bottle of wine and provided me everything I needed to know, not just about the boat but the city as well.<br/>The only regret is that I couldn't stay longer<br/>"
794322,82197225.0,6/26/2016,20223595,Joelle,"We had a great time staying in Lydia's houseboat. It's in a great location, really central, the canal is quiet at night when you want some sleep but also busy enough to sit on deck with a glass of wine and watch all the boats go by, which we did one night! We didn't get to meet Lydia as she was away with work but Berny was there to meet us and was really lovely, even did some washing for me. I'd say the boat is as pictured, small but big enough, especially for us as we'd spent 2 weeks in our Campervan. The shower is good. It is a little bit tired and could do with a bit of decorating and new bedding, the pillows were particularly lumpy but overall we loved the experience of staying in a houseboat. Lydia had also left some wine, beers, cheese, salami, milk etc which was a lovely touch."
794322,82986529.0,6/30/2016,68272155,Scott,"Lydia's boat was amazing Me and my wife really enjoyed it and would love to come back at some point ,we were met by Lydia at the boat and given a run down of the boat and Could not have been more hospitable , she even provided some wine and some snacks to settle in which was great to sit on the deck with ,the boat is in a great central area and walking distance to Dam square , supermarket and the local bars can not recommend it highly enough "

Insgesamt war es sehr sauber und dem Zweck entsprechend gemütlich eingerichtet. <br/>Ein Infozettel zu dem Umfeld, wie man Sehenswürdigkeiten, Supermärkte, Cafés etc. erreicht lag bereit. <br/>Insgesamt ist die Unterkunft gut gelegen, man läuft etwa 15 Minuten bis man Geschäfte erreicht und nachts war es sehr ruhig. (Kostenpflichtiges) Parken ist in der Umgebung der Unterkunft zahlreich möglich, sonntags ist es sogar kostenfrei.<br/>Alles in allem eine schöne Unterkunft für eine Städtereise nach Amsterdam!"

Il nous ont même permis de rester un peu plus en s'arrangeant avec les clients qui devient venir après et qui ont été très sympas aussi. Le logement est très accessible depuis le centre, pas de souci ! Nous conseillons ce logement"
553514,21957256.0,10/27/2014,13765244,Fiona,Lovely cosy studio flat. Great garden & very central. Hired bikes & only a 5 minute cycle into the centre. Everything we needed in the flat & Mirjam was flexible with our departure time which was great.
553514,22202083.0,11/1/2014,22390707,Fabrice,"Nous sommes ravis de l'accueil sincère et chaleureux de Didi et Mirjam. <br/>L'appartement est fidèle à la description, un brin original et suffisant pour 2 adultes et 2 enfants. Il est situé dans un quartier à l'ouest d'Amsterdam, à seulement 5 minutes en vélo du ""Jordaan"". Nous n'avons d'ailleurs circulé qu'en vélo durant le séjour. Il y a des commerces à proximité et un loueur de vélo à 100m, un peu ""bourru"" mais serviable et moins cher qu'en centre ville.<br/>Bref nous avons été comblé et si c'est à refaire, c'est sans hésitation....<br/>Fabrice B."
553514,22301797.0,11/3/2014,8509610,Patrick,They made us feel very welcome with flowers wine and guides. The neighborhood is a short cycle from the centre and has lots going on. Was very relaxing!

28871,518885128.0,8/27/2019,44883343,Bev,"Edwin offers exactly as advertised- a comfortable double room. I’ll add that all facilities were clean too. Bathroom was shared but this didn’t cause any problems and was located just outside the room, as was a small fridge and the makings for coffee/tea. Communication was clear and prompt and the location is great, with plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops close. Tram stop just a couple of minutes walk away.  Recommend for solo traveller."

Obwohl wir schon früher dagewesen war Bernie gleich da um uns alles zu zeigen. Sehr hübsch eingerichtet man fühlt si h sofort wie zu Hause. Wichtig auch die Lage deines Hausbootes. Sehr zentral gelegen vieles zu Fuß zu erreichen . 100 Punkte und mehr"

794322,88195097.0,7/23/2016,56721609,Daniel,"We stayed on the house boat for half a day and had to relocate due to it being undesirable living conditions. Should be labeled as ""Rustic"" instead of ""Romantic"", We upgraded our honeymoon stay to a hotel due to it being dusty, dirty, and hot. Hope the owner fixes up the place."

Fun canal to be on, and not too noisy either. Lydia was very friendly and accommodating. She provided lots of tips for what to do around the city. It was a great experience."
794322,93612221.0,8/13/2016,7966471,Susheel,Lydia was a great host. The boat was a great experience. But smaller then the pics but other than that everything is as is. So close to all the restaurants and tourist area. We took a canal cruise and it goes by this houseboat as well. Definitely would recommend it for those into spending time along the canal sitting outdoors. No smell of water and wifi works great. 
794322,94051691.0,8/14/2016,68057219,Jennie,"Had a really really lovely stay, Lydia was so helpful. She allowed us to come a little earlier than the stated check in time because she knew our flight got in early and was able to help us out with getting our tickets to Anne Frank's. She had also left some wine and snacks for us which was amazing. The location is perfect, really close to the centre but not too busy or loud, a lovely neighbourhood. The boat is charming, it's exactly as it looks in the pictures, would definitely stay again.   "
794322,100040414.0,9/7/2016,79004762,Debbie,"The location is perfect, 5 minute walk to the hustle and bustle but overall quiet and laid-back. The barge is cosy and rustic, more than enough space for a short break. A great alternative to the usual hotel. "
794322,103699759.0,9/23/2016,68118979,Stephanie,"Not sure where to start, but Lydia was the absolute best host ever. She remembered that we were traveling for our birthdays, and when we walked in, there were flowers, birthday hats and treats, wine and traditional cakes for us. <br/>She is one of the busiest women I've ever met, but she still made time to get us anything we needed.<br/>Our last evening in Amsterdam we got to know Lydia even more and became good friends. I can't say enough great things about her! I just look forward to making an annual trip back there again. <br/>Apart from Lydia, the boat is truly in the center of everything. Walking distance to every sight we wanted to see. It is a very romantic city, and the houseboat has a charm that's unbeatable. Just sitting on the top deck, enjoying a glass of wine, watching everything around you is great. And the people of Amsterdam are so friendly, not once did I feel unsafe. "
794322,104002750.0,9/25/2016,52535380,Kaylie,Host was easy to contact and check in with. The man who helps out lived just next door so he was nearby if you needed anything. The place was beautiful and centrally located to anything you need. Great host!

794322,110102880.0,10/24/2016,90689869,Karen,"The perfect place to stay in Amsterdam. I'm not dutch, but to me this place just screams ""Gezellig.""  The houseboat was Cozy, Rustic, Romantic...! It is located on a quiet street,  but just around the corner you are in the heart of Amsterdam.  Waking up and sipping coffee on the deck watching the day unfold, was an amazing experience.  The views at night on the deck, enjoying a glass of wine were even more breathtaking! Our host was working when we arrived, but her assistant welcomed us and told us where all the local stops were.  The restaurant he recommended a block from the boat was so good, we ate there twice. This as a must-do experience for Amsterdam.  I hope one day to come back!"
