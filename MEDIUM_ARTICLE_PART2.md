# From Keywords to Context: Adding AI-Powered Semantic Search to My Sentiment Analysis App

## How I transformed my Airbnb review app with OpenAI embeddings in just 90 minutes for less than a penny

---

When I published [Part 1](link-to-part-1) of building my sentiment analysis app, I thought I was done. The app could analyze sentiment, visualize trends, and let users browse through thousands of Airbnb reviews. Mission accomplished, right?

Then I remembered Dr. Lee's challenge and saw the Windsurf prompt: **"Turn your Airbnb data into smart search using OpenAI embeddings."**

I realized my app had a critical limitation: it could only find exact keyword matches. If someone searched for "not clean," they'd miss reviews saying "dirty" or "filthy." If they looked for "responsive host," they wouldn't find "excellent host" or "friendly host."

**Time to upgrade.**

---

## The Problem with Keyword Search

Traditional keyword search is like looking for a needle in a haystack—but only if the needle is spelled exactly the way you're searching for it.

**Here's what I mean:**

![Semantic Search vs Keyword Search - "ugly place" query showing 0 keyword results vs 10 semantic results](image-placeholder-ugly-place.png)
*Keyword search found 0 results for "ugly place" while semantic search found 10 reviews discussing the place's characteristics. The AI understands the query is about place quality, even without exact word matches.*

The screenshot above shows the dramatic difference: searching for "ugly place" returns zero keyword results but finds 10 semantically relevant reviews about the place's quality.

The problem? **Keyword search understands words, not meaning.**

---

## The Solution: Semantic Search

Semantic search uses AI to understand *concepts* instead of just matching *words*. It converts text into mathematical vectors (embeddings) that capture meaning, then finds reviews that are conceptually similar.

**Think of it like this:**
- Keyword search: "Does this review contain these exact words?"
- Semantic search: "What does this review *mean*, and what other reviews mean something similar?"

---

## The Challenge

**Goal:** Add AI-powered semantic search to my existing app
**Time budget:** One evening
**Cost budget:** Minimal (I'm on free-tier hosting)
**Tech:** OpenAI embeddings + Python + React

**Let's build it.**

---

## Part 1: Setup (6 minutes)

First, I needed the right tools. OpenAI's embedding API would convert text to vectors, and scikit-learn would calculate similarity.

```bash
# Add to requirements.txt
openai>=1.0.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

pip install openai scikit-learn python-dotenv
```

I created a `.env` file for my OpenAI API key (never commit API keys to GitHub!):

```python
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files:

```
# .gitignore
.env
embeddings_cache.pkl
```

**Time elapsed: 6 minutes**

---

## Part 2: Building the Semantic Search Engine (11 minutes)

I created a new module `semantic_search.py` to handle the AI magic:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import pickle
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

class SemanticSearchEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embeddings = None
        self.reviews_data = None
    
    def generate_embedding(self, text):
        """Convert text to 1536-dimensional vector"""
        response = client.embeddings.create(
            model="text-embedding-3-small",  # Cost-effective choice
            input=text
        )
        return response.data[0].embedding
    
    def create_embeddings(self, df):
        """Generate embeddings for all reviews with caching"""
        cache_file = 'embeddings_cache.pkl'
        
        # Check if cache exists
        if os.path.exists(cache_file):
            print("✅ Loading embeddings from cache...")
            with open(cache_file, 'rb') as f:
                cache_data = pickle.load(f)
                self.embeddings = cache_data['embeddings']
                self.reviews_data = cache_data['reviews_data']
            print(f"✅ Loaded {len(self.embeddings)} embeddings from cache")
            return
        
        # Generate new embeddings
        print("Creating embeddings for reviews...")
        embeddings = []
        reviews_data = []
        
        for idx, row in df.iterrows():
            if idx % 100 == 0:
                print(f"Processing {idx}/{len(df)} reviews...")
            
            embedding = self.generate_embedding(row['comments'])
            embeddings.append(embedding)
            reviews_data.append({
                'id': int(row['id']),
                'comments': str(row['comments']),
                'date': str(row['date']),
                'reviewer_name': str(row['reviewer_name'])
            })
        
        self.embeddings = np.array(embeddings)
        self.reviews_data = reviews_data
        
        # Cache for future use
        with open(cache_file, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump({
                'embeddings': self.embeddings,
                'reviews_data': self.reviews_data
            }, f)
        
        print(f"✅ Created and cached {len(self.embeddings)} embeddings")
    
    def search(self, query, top_k=20):
        """Find reviews semantically similar to the query"""
        # Convert query to embedding
        query_embedding = self.generate_embedding(query)
        query_vector = np.array(query_embedding).reshape(1, -1)
        
        # Calculate cosine similarity with all reviews
        similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vector, self.embeddings)[0]
        
        # Get top K matches
        top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1][:top_k]
        
        results = []
        for idx in top_indices:
            result = self.reviews_data[idx].copy()
            result['similarity_score'] = float(similarities[idx])
            results.append(result)
        
        return results
```

**Key decisions:**
- **Caching:** Generate embeddings once, reuse forever (saves time and money)
- **Model choice:** `text-embedding-3-small` is 5x cheaper than `ada-002`
- **Cosine similarity:** Measures the "angle" between vectors (0 = unrelated, 1 = identical)

**Time elapsed: 17 minutes**

## Part 3: Generating Embeddings (22 minutes)

This was the longest part—converting 2,996 reviews into embeddings.

I updated my Flask app to initialize semantic search on startup:

```python
from semantic_search import SemanticSearchEngine

# Initialize semantic search engine
semantic_search_engine = SemanticSearchEngine()

def load_data(sample_size=3000):
    """Load reviews and generate embeddings"""
    # ... load reviews with VADER sentiment ...
    
    # Initialize semantic search
    print("Initializing semantic search...")
    semantic_search_engine.create_embeddings(df_with_sentiment)
    print("Semantic search ready!")
```

**What happened:**
```
Loading data...
Removed 4 duplicate reviews
Loaded 2996 unique reviews

```

**Cost:** ~$0.01 for 2,996 reviews
**Time:** ~20 minutes (first run), <1 second (cached)
**Cache size:** 12 MB

**Time elapsed: 39 minutes**

---

## Part 4: Building the API Endpoints (5 minutes)

I added two new endpoints to compare keyword vs semantic search:

```python
@app.route('/api/semantic-search', methods=['POST'])
def semantic_search():
    """Search reviews using AI-powered semantic search"""
    data = request.json
    query = data.get('query', '')
    top_k = data.get('top_k', 20)
    
    if not query:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No query provided'}), 400
    
    try:
        results = semantic_search_engine.search(query, top_k=top_k)
        return jsonify({
            'query': query,
            'results': results,
            'total': len(results),
            'search_type': 'semantic'
        })
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

@app.route('/api/keyword-search', methods=['POST'])
def keyword_search():
    """Traditional keyword search for comparison"""
    data = request.json
    query = data.get('query', '')
    top_k = data.get('top_k', 20)
    
    # Simple case-insensitive string matching
    filtered_df = df[
        df['comments'].str.contains(query, case=False, na=False)
    ].head(top_k)
    
    results = filtered_df.to_dict('records')
    
    return jsonify({
        'query': query,
        'results': results,
        'total': len(results),
        'search_type': 'keyword'
    })
```

**Time elapsed: 44 minutes**

---

## Part 5: Building the Frontend (31 minutes)

The real magic happens when users can *see* the difference. I built a side-by-side comparison view.

I created a new React component `SemanticSearch.js`:

```javascript
function SemanticSearch() {
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
  const [keywordResults, setKeywordResults] = useState(null);
  const [semanticResults, setSemanticResults] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleSearch = async () => {
    if (!searchQuery.trim()) return;
    
    setLoading(true);

    // Fetch both keyword and semantic results in parallel
    const [keywordResponse, semanticResponse] = await Promise.all([
      axios.post(`${API_URL}/keyword-search`, { query: searchQuery, top_k: 10 }),
      axios.post(`${API_URL}/semantic-search`, { query: searchQuery, top_k: 10 })
    ]);

    setKeywordResults(keywordResponse.data);
    setSemanticResults(semanticResponse.data);
    setLoading(false);
  };

  return (
    <div className="semantic-search-container">
      {/* Search Input */}
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Try: 'not clean', 'responsive host'..."
        value={searchQuery}
        onChange={(e) => setSearchQuery(e.target.value)}
        onKeyPress={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleSearch()}
      />
      
      {/* Side-by-side Results */}
      <div className="results-comparison">
        {/* Keyword Results */}
        <div className="keyword-column">
          <h3>Traditional Keyword Search</h3>
          <span>{keywordResults?.total || 0} results</span>
          {keywordResults?.results?.map((result, index) => (
            <div key={index} className="result-card">
              <p>{result.comments}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>

        {/* Semantic Results */}
        <div className="semantic-column">
          <h3>AI-Powered Semantic Search</h3>
          <span>{semanticResults?.total || 0} results</span>
          {semanticResults?.results?.map((result, index) => (
            <div key={index} className="result-card">
              <span className="similarity-score">
                {(result.similarity_score * 100).toFixed(1)}% match
              </span>
              <p>{result.comments}</p>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Improvement Metrics */}
      <div className="improvement-stats">
        <div className="stat-card">
          <div className="stat-value">
            +{semanticResults?.total - keywordResults?.total}
          </div>
          <div className="stat-label">More Results Found</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

I added a new tab to the navigation with a sparkles icon (✨) to make it obvious this is the AI-powered feature.

**Time elapsed: 1 hour 15 minutes**

---

## Part 6: Testing (12 minutes)

Time to see if it actually works. I tested several queries:

### Test 1: "ugly place"
**Keyword Search:** 0 results ❌
**Semantic Search:** 10 results ✅
- "Nice place" (56.0% match)
- "Good place" (55.2% match)
- "Very nice place" (52.7% match)

**Why it works:** The AI understands the query is about place quality, so it finds all reviews discussing the place's characteristics.

### Test 2: "responsive host"

![Side-by-side comparison of keyword vs semantic search for "responsive host"](image-placeholder-responsive-host.png)
*Side-by-side comparison: Semantic search doubles the results by understanding that "excellent," "friendly," and "amazing" are conceptually similar to "responsive." The similarity scores show how closely each review matches the query.*

**Keyword Search:** 5 results
**Semantic Search:** 10 results ✅
- "Excellent host" (55.0% match)
- "Friendly host and well located" (41.7% match)
- "Great location and very responsive host" (41.0% match)
- "great place great host" (37.1% match)
- "Amazing host, very easy location" (34.3% match)

**Improvement:** 200% more results!

**Why it works:** The AI finds synonyms and related concepts that keyword search misses.

### Test 3: "not clean"
**Keyword Search:** 0 results ❌
**Semantic Search:** 10 results ✅
- Reviews mentioning "dirty," "filthy," "needs cleaning"

**Time elapsed: 1 hour 27 minutes**

---

## Part 7: Deployment (25 minutes)

### Backend (Render)
1. Committed code to GitHub
2. Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to Render
3. Render auto-deployed and generated embeddings (~20 minutes)

### Frontend (Netlify)
1. Updated API URL to production
2. Pushed to GitHub
3. Netlify auto-deployed (~2 minutes)

**Total deployment time:** ~25 minutes (mostly waiting for embeddings)

**Time elapsed: 1 hour 52 minutes**

---

## The Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Development time:** 1 hour 27 minutes
- **Deployment time:** 25 minutes
- **Total time:** 1 hour 52 minutes
- **Cost:** $0.01 for embeddings
- **Per-search cost:** ~$0.0001
- **Cache file size:** 12 MB
- **Search response time:** <2 seconds

### Search Improvements
- **"ugly place":** ∞% improvement (0 → 10 results)
- **"responsive host":** 200% improvement (5 → 10 results)
- **Average improvement:** 100%+ more relevant results

### User Experience
Before: Users had to guess the exact words used in reviews
After: Users can search by concept and find what they mean, not just what they type

---

## Cost Analysis

**One-Time Costs:**
- Embeddings generation: $0.01 for 3,000 reviews

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Per search query: ~$0.0001
- 1,000 searches/month: ~$0.10
- **Total monthly cost: $0.10**

For less than the cost of a coffee, I added AI-powered search to my entire app.

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Caching is Essential
First run took 20 minutes. Every subsequent run: instant. Always cache embeddings.

### 2. Choose the Right Model
`text-embedding-3-small` is 5x cheaper than `ada-002` with similar quality. For a portfolio project, it's perfect.

### 3. Semantic ≠ Always Better
Semantic search excels at:
- Conceptual queries ("responsive host" → "excellent host")
- Synonyms ("not clean" → "dirty")
- Related terms ("noisy" → "loud")

Keyword search is still useful for:
- Exact phrases
- Specific IDs or names
- Technical terms

### 4. Show the Difference
Side-by-side comparison makes the value obvious. Users immediately see why semantic search is better.

### 5. Start Small, Scale Later
I started with 3,000 reviews. The full dataset has 342,904 reviews. Starting small let me:
- Iterate quickly
- Keep costs minimal
- Deploy on free-tier hosting
- Prove the concept before scaling

---

## What's Next?

In [Part 1](link-to-part-1), I promised several enhancements. **We just completed the first one: Semantic Search with OpenAI Embeddings!** ✅

**Still on the roadmap:**
- **Multi-language Support:** Analyze reviews in different languages (OpenAI embeddings already support this!)
- **Trend Prediction:** ML model to forecast sentiment patterns
- **Custom Dataset Upload:** Let users analyze their own review data
- **Real-time Analysis:** WebSocket integration for live processing

**Additional ideas for future parts:**
- **Hybrid search:** Combine keyword + semantic for best of both worlds
- **Advanced filters:** Add sentiment, date, rating filters to semantic search
- **Semantic clustering:** Group similar reviews to find themes automatically
- **Real-time embeddings:** Generate embeddings for new reviews as they're added

**Stay tuned for Part 3!** 🚀

- "not clean" = 0 results
- One way to search

**After:**
- AI-powered context understanding
- "not clean" = finds "dirty," "filthy," "needs cleaning"
- Understands what you mean, not just what you type

**Time Investment:** 2 hours
**Cost:** $0.01
**Impact:** Transformed user experience

## Final Thoughts

### From Google Colab to Production

In class, we built search engines using Google Colab and Gradio—quick prototypes that lived in notebooks. They worked, but they were temporary. When the session ended, so did the app.

I wanted more. I wanted something real, something I could share, something that would still be running tomorrow.

**So I transitioned away from Google Colab to real-world tools:**
- **Windsurf (Cascade AI)** for pair programming and development
- **Render** for backend hosting
- **Netlify** for frontend deployment
- **GitHub** for version control

It was frustrating that I couldn't upload the whole dataset (342,904 reviews) due to free-tier limitations. But I realized something important: **constraints force creativity.** I optimized. I cached. I made smart choices. And I built something that actually works in production.

### The Lesson That Stuck

Dr. Ernesto Lee's words are engraved in my mind. He also shared this quote with us:

> **"Code is no longer the barrier. Your imagination is."**  
> — Anonymous Developer, 2025

His dedication to students, his commitment to education, his vocation, and the inspiration he provides—it takes you out of your comfort zone and makes you think about what problems are out there that need fixing.

My work is primarily pragmatic (for college purposes), but it provided something more valuable: **certainty that nothing is impossible.**

### What I Really Learned

When I started this project, I wanted to learn sentiment analysis. I ended up mastering so much more:
- Natural Language Processing with VADER
- Vector embeddings and similarity search
- Full-stack deployment
- Cost optimization for AI features
- The difference between building a feature and building a *good* feature
- **How to turn complex AI concepts into production-ready code**

Building an AI-powered search engine. Deploying to production. Understanding embeddings. Six months ago, these were just buzzwords. Today, they're skills in my toolkit.

The Windsurf challenge didn't just ask me to add semantic search—it challenged me to level up. And for less than a penny and a couple of hours, I did.

**The barrier isn't knowledge. It's taking the first step.**

**Your turn.** The code is open source. The knowledge is free. The only cost is your time—and the courage to try.
